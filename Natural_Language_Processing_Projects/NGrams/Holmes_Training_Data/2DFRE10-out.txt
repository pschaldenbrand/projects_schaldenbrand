<s> Note The sixteenth chapter I cannot help considering as a very ingenious and specious but very disgraceful extenuation of the cruelties perpetrated by the Roman magistrates against the Christians </s>
<s> It is written in the most contemptibly factious spirit of prejudice against the sufferers it is unworthy of a philosopher and of humanity </s>
<s> Let the narrative of Cyprian's death be examined </s>
<s> He had to relate the murder of an innocent man of advanced age and in a station deemed venerable by a considerable body of the provincials of Africa put to death because he refused to sacrifice to Jupiter </s>
<s> Instead of pointing the indignation of posterity against such an atrocious act of tyranny he dwells with visible art on the small circumstances of decorum and politeness which attended this murder and which he relates with as much parade as if they were the most important particulars of the event </s>
<s> The Conduct Of The Roman Government Towards The Christians From The Reign Of Nero To That Of Constantine </s>
<s> Dr. Robertson has been the subject of much blame for his real or supposed lenity towards the Spanish murderers and tyrants in America </s>
<s> That the sixteenth chapter of Mr. G </s>

<s> 244 245.] If we seriously consider the purity of the Christian religion the sanctity of its moral precepts and the innocent as well as austere lives of the greater number of those who during the first ages embraced the faith of the gospel we should naturally suppose that so benevolent a doctrine would have been received with due reverence even by the unbelieving world that the learned and the polite however they may deride the miracles would have esteemed the virtues of the new sect and that the magistrates instead of persecuting would have protected an order of men who yielded the most passive obedience to the laws though they declined the active cares of war and government </s>
<s> If on the other hand we recollect the universal toleration of Polytheism as it was invariably maintained by the faith of the people the incredulity of philosophers and the policy of the Roman senate and emperors we are at a loss to discover what new offence the Christians had committed what new provocation could exasperate the mild indifference of antiquity and what new motives could urge the Roman princes who beheld without concern a thousand forms of religion subsisting in peace under their gentle sway to inflict a severe punishment on any part of their subjects who had chosen for themselves a singular but an inoffensive mode of faith and worship </s>
<s> The religious policy of the ancient world seems to have assumed a more stern and intolerant character to oppose the progress of Christianity </s>
<s> About fourscore years after the death of Christ his innocent disciples were punished with death by the sentence of a proconsul of the most amiable and philosophic character and according to the laws of an emperor distinguished by the wisdom and justice of his general administration </s>
<s> The apologies which were repeatedly addressed to the successors of Trajan are filled with the most pathetic complaints that the Christians who obeyed the dictates and solicited the liberty of conscience were alone among all the subjects of the Roman empire excluded from the common benefits of their auspicious government </s>
<s> The deaths of a few eminent martyrs have been recorded with care and from the time that Christianity was invested with the supreme power the governors of the church have been no less diligently employed in displaying the cruelty than in imitating the conduct of their Pagan adversaries </s>
<s> To separate if it be possible a few authentic as well as interesting facts from an undigested mass of fiction and error and to relate in a clear and rational manner the causes the extent the duration and the most important circumstances of the persecutions to which the first Christians were exposed is the design of the present chapter </s>
<s> [Footnote The history of the first age of Christianity is only found in the Acts of the Apostles and in order to speak of the first persecutions experienced by the Christians that book should naturally have been consulted those persecutions then limited to individuals and to a narrow sphere interested only the persecuted and have been related by them alone </s>
<s> Gibbon making the persecutions ascend no higher than Nero has entirely omitted those which preceded this epoch and of which St. Luke has preserved the memory </s>
<s> The only way to justify this omission was to attack the authenticity of the Acts of the Apostles for if authentic they must necessarily be consulted and quoted </s>
<s> Now antiquity has left very few works of which the authenticity is so well established as that of the Acts of the Apostles </s>
<s> See Lardner's Cred </s>
<s> of Gospel Hist </s>

<s> It is therefore without sufficient reason that Gibbon has maintained silence concerning the narrative of St. Luke and this omission is not without importance </s>
<s> G.] The sectaries of a persecuted religion depressed by fear animated with resentment and perhaps heated by enthusiasm are seldom in a proper temper of mind calmly to investigate or candidly to appreciate the motives of their enemies which often escape the impartial and discerning view even of those who are placed at a secure distance from the flames of persecution </s>
<s> A reason has been assigned for the conduct of the emperors towards the primitive Christians which may appear the more specious and probable as it is drawn from the acknowledged genius of Polytheism </s>
<s> It has already been observed that the religious concord of the world was principally supported by the implicit assent and reverence which the nations of antiquity expressed for their respective traditions and ceremonies </s>
<s> It might therefore be expected that they would unite with indignation against any sect or people which should separate itself from the communion of mankind and claiming the exclusive possession of divine knowledge should disdain every form of worship except its own as impious and idolatrous </s>
<s> The rights of toleration were held by mutual indulgence they were justly forfeited by a refusal of the accustomed tribute </s>
<s> As the payment of this tribute was inflexibly refused by the Jews and by them alone the consideration of the treatment which they experienced from the Roman magistrates will serve to explain how far these speculations are justified by facts and will lead us to discover the true causes of the persecution of Christianity </s>
<s> Without repeating what has already been mentioned of the reverence of the Roman princes and governors for the temple of Jerusalem we shall only observe that the destruction of the temple and city was accompanied and followed by every circumstance that could exasperate the minds of the conquerors and authorize religious persecution by the most specious arguments of political justice and the public safety </s>
<s> From the reign of Nero to that of Antoninus Pius the Jews discovered a fierce impatience of the dominion of Rome which repeatedly broke out in the most furious massacres and insurrections </s>
<s> Humanity is shocked at the recital of the horrid cruelties which they committed in the cities of Egypt of Cyprus and of Cyrene where they dwelt in treacherous friendship with the unsuspecting natives 1 and we are tempted to applaud the severe retaliation which was exercised by the arms of the legions against a race of fanatics whose dire and credulous superstition seemed to render them the implacable enemies not only of the Roman government but of human kind </s>
<s> 2 The enthusiasm of the Jews was supported by the opinion that it was unlawful for them to pay taxes to an idolatrous master and by the flattering promise which they derived from their ancient oracles that a conquering Messiah would soon arise destined to break their fetters and to invest the favorites of heaven with the empire of the earth </s>
<s> It was by announcing himself as their longexpected deliverer and by calling on all the descendants of Abraham to assert the hope of Israel that the famous Barchochebas collected a formidable army with which he resisted during two years the power of the emperor Hadrian </s>
<s> 3 [Footnote 1 In Cyrene they massacred 220000 Greeks in Cyprus 240000 in Egypt a very great multitude </s>
<s> Many of these unhappy victims were sawn asunder according to a precedent to which David had given the sanction of his example </s>

<s> By the general indulgence of polytheism and by the mild temper of Antoninus Pius the Jews were restored to their ancient privileges and once more obtained the permission of circumcising their children with the easy restraint that they should never confer on any foreign proselyte that distinguishing mark of the Hebrew race </s>
<s> 4 The numerous remains of that people though they were still excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem were permitted to form and to maintain considerable establishments both in Italy and in the provinces to acquire the freedom of Rome to enjoy municipal honors and to obtain at the same time an exemption from the burdensome and expensive offices of society </s>
<s> The moderation or the contempt of the Romans gave a legal sanction to the form of ecclesiastical police which was instituted by the vanquished sect </s>
<s> The patriarch who had fixed his residence at Tiberias was empowered to appoint his subordinate ministers and apostles to exercise a domestic jurisdiction and to receive from his dispersed brethren an annual contribution </s>
<s> 5 New synagogues were frequently erected in the principal cities of the empire and the sabbaths the fasts and the festivals which were either commanded by the Mosaic law or enjoined by the traditions of the Rabbis were celebrated in the most solemn and public manner </s>
<s> 6 Such gentle treatment insensibly assuaged the stern temper of the Jews </s>
<s> Awakened from their dream of prophecy and conquest they assumed the behavior of peaceable and industrious subjects </s>

<s> M.] Since the Jews who rejected with abhorrence the deities adored by their sovereign and by their fellowsubjects enjoyed however the free exercise of their unsocial religion there must have existed some other cause which exposed the disciples of Christ to those severities from which the posterity of Abraham was exempt </s>
<s> The difference between them is simple and obvious but according to the sentiments of antiquity it was of the highest importance </s>
<s> The Jews were a nation the Christians were a sect and if it was natural for every community to respect the sacred institutions of their neighbors it was incumbent on them to persevere in those of their ancestors </s>
<s> The voice of oracles the precepts of philosophers and the authority of the laws unanimously enforced this national obligation </s>
<s> By their lofty claim of superior sanctity the Jews might provoke the Polytheists to consider them as an odious and impure race </s>
<s> By disdaining the intercourse of other nations they might deserve their contempt </s>
<s> The laws of Moses might be for the most part frivolous or absurd yet since they had been received during many ages by a large society his followers were justified by the example of mankind and it was universally acknowledged that they had a right to practise what it would have been criminal in them to neglect </s>
<s> But this principle which protected the Jewish synagogue afforded not any favor or security to the primitive church </s>
<s> By embracing the faith of the gospel the Christians incurred the supposed guilt of an unnatural and unpardonable offence </s>
<s> They dissolved the sacred ties of custom and education violated the religious institutions of their country and presumptuously despised whatever their fathers had believed as true or had reverenced as sacred </s>
<s> Nor was this apostasy if we may use the expression merely of a partial or local kind since the pious deserter who withdrew himself from the temples of Egypt or Syria would equally disdain to seek an asylum in those of Athens or Carthage </s>
<s> Every Christian rejected with contempt the superstitions of his family his city and his province </s>
<s> The whole body of Christians unanimously refused to hold any communion with the gods of Rome of the empire and of mankind </s>
<s> It was in vain that the oppressed believer asserted the inalienable rights of conscience and private judgment </s>
<s> Though his situation might excite the pity his arguments could never reach the understanding either of the philosophic or of the believing part of the Pagan world </s>
<s> To their apprehensions it was no less a matter of surprise that any individuals should entertain scruples against complying with the established mode of worship than if they had conceived a sudden abhorrence to the manners the dress or the language of their native country </s>

<s> 5 6 a fair and not inelegant description of the popular sentiments with regard to the desertion of the established worship.] [Footnote In all this there is doubtless much truth yet does not the more important difference lie on the surface </s>
<s> The Christians made many converts the Jews but few </s>
<s> Had the Jewish been equally a proselyting religion would it not have encountered as violent persecution </s>
<s> M.] The surprise of the Pagans was soon succeeded by resentment and the most pious of men were exposed to the unjust but dangerous imputation of impiety </s>
<s> Malice and prejudice concurred in representing the Christians as a society of atheists who by the most daring attack on the religious constitution of the empire had merited the severest animadversion of the civil magistrate </s>
<s> They had separated themselves they gloried in the confession from every mode of superstition which was received in any part of the globe by the various temper of polytheism but it was not altogether so evident what deity or what form of worship they had substituted to the gods and temples of antiquity </s>
<s> The pure and sublime idea which they entertained of the Supreme Being escaped the gross conception of the Pagan multitude who were at a loss to discover a spiritual and solitary God that was neither represented under any corporeal figure or visible symbol nor was adored with the accustomed pomp of libations and festivals of altars and sacrifices </s>
<s> 9 The sages of Greece and Rome who had elevated their minds to the contemplation of the existence and attributes of the First Cause were induced by reason or by vanity to reserve for themselves and their chosen disciples the privilege of this philosophical devotion </s>
<s> 10 They were far from admitting the prejudices of mankind as the standard of truth but they considered them as flowing from the original disposition of human nature and they supposed that any popular mode of faith and worship which presumed to disclaim the assistance of the senses would in proportion as it receded from superstition find itself incapable of restraining the wanderings of the fancy and the visions of fanaticism </s>
<s> The careless glance which men of wit and learning condescended to cast on the Christian revelation served only to confirm their hasty opinion and to persuade them that the principle which they might have revered of the Divine Unity was defaced by the wild enthusiasm and annihilated by the airy speculations of the new sectaries </s>
<s> The author of a celebrated dialogue which has been attributed to Lucian whilst he affects to treat the mysterious subject of the Trinity in a style of ridicule and contempt betrays his own ignorance of the weakness of human reason and of the inscrutable nature of the divine perfections </s>

<s> The Polytheists were disposed to adopt every article of faith which seemed to offer any resemblance however distant or imperfect with the popular mythology and the legends of Bacchus of Hercules and of Aesculapius had in some measure prepared their imagination for the appearance of the Son of God under a human form </s>
<s> 12 But they were astonished that the Christians should abandon the temples of those ancient heroes who in the infancy of the world had invented arts instituted laws and vanquished the tyrants or monsters who infested the earth in order to choose for the exclusive object of their religious worship an obscure teacher who in a recent age and among a barbarous people had fallen a sacrifice either to the malice of his own countrymen or to the jealousy of the Roman government </s>
<s> The Pagan multitude reserving their gratitude for temporal benefits alone rejected the inestimable present of life and immortality which was offered to mankind by Jesus of Nazareth </s>

<s> It is well known and has been already observed that Roman policy viewed with the utmost jealousy and distrust any association among its subjects and that the privileges of private corporations though formed for the most harmless or beneficial purposes were bestowed with a very sparing hand </s>
<s> 14 The religious assemblies of the Christians who had separated themselves from the public worship appeared of a much less innocent nature they were illegal in their principle and in their consequences might become dangerous nor were the emperors conscious that they violated the laws of justice when for the peace of society they prohibited those secret and sometimes nocturnal meetings </s>
<s> 15 The pious disobedience of the Christians made their conduct or perhaps their designs appear in a much more serious and criminal light and the Roman princes who might perhaps have suffered themselves to be disarmed by a ready submission deeming their honor concerned in the execution of their commands sometimes attempted by rigorous punishments to subdue this independent spirit which boldly acknowledged an authority superior to that of the magistrate </s>
<s> The extent and duration of this spiritual conspiracy seemed to render it everyday more deserving of his animadversion </s>
<s> We have already seen that the active and successful zeal of the Christians had insensibly diffused them through every province and almost every city of the empire </s>
<s> The new converts seemed to renounce their family and country that they might connect themselves in an indissoluble band of union with a peculiar society which every where assumed a different character from the rest of mankind </s>
<s> Their gloomy and austere aspect their abhorrence of the common business and pleasures of life and their frequent predictions of impending calamities 16 inspired the Pagans with the apprehension of some danger which would arise from the new sect the more alarming as it was the more obscure </s>

<s> The same reason which contributes to alleviate the guilt must have tended to abate the vigor of their persecutions </s>
<s> As they were actuated not by the furious zeal of bigots but by the temperate policy of legislators contempt must often have relaxed and humanity must frequently have suspended the execution of those laws which they enacted against the humble and obscure followers of Christ </s>

<s> Notwithstanding the careless indifference which the most copious and the most minute of the Pagan writers have shown to the affairs of the Christians 24 it may still be in our power to confirm each of these probable suppositions by the evidence of authentic facts </s>

<s> The voice of rumor accused the emperor as the incendiary of his own capital and as the most incredible stories are the best adapted to the genius of an enraged people it was gravely reported and firmly believed that Nero enjoying the calamity which he had occasioned amused himself with singing to his lyre the destruction of ancient Troy </s>

<s> The most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect the truth of this extraordinary fact and the integrity of this celebrated passage of Tacitus </s>
<s> The former is confirmed by the diligent and accurate Suetonius who mentions the punishment which Nero inflicted on the Christians a sect of men who had embraced a new and criminal superstition </s>
<s> 35 The latter may be proved by the consent of the most ancient manuscripts by the inimitable character of the style of Tacitus by his reputation which guarded his text from the interpolations of pious fraud and by the purport of his narration which accused the first Christians of the most atrocious crimes without insinuating that they possessed any miraculous or even magical powers above the rest of mankind </s>
<s> 36 2 </s>
<s> Notwithstanding it is probable that Tacitus was born some years before the fire of Rome 37 he could derive only from reading and conversation the knowledge of an event which happened during his infancy </s>
<s> Before he gave himself to the public he calmly waited till his genius had attained its full maturity and he was more than forty years of age when a grateful regard for the memory of the virtuous Agricola extorted from him the most early of those historical compositions which will delight and instruct the most distant posterity </s>
<s> After making a trial of his strength in the life of Agricola and the description of Germany he conceived and at length executed a more arduous work the history of Rome in thirty books from the fall of Nero to the accession of Nerva </s>
<s> The administration of Nerva introduced an age of justice and propriety which Tacitus had destined for the occupation of his old age 38 but when he took a nearer view of his subject judging perhaps that it was a more honorable or a less invidious office to record the vices of past tyrants than to celebrate the virtues of a reigning monarch he chose rather to relate under the form of annals the actions of the four immediate successors of Augustus </s>
<s> To collect to dispose and to adorn a series of fourscore years in an immortal work every sentence of which is pregnant with the deepest observations and the most lively images was an undertaking sufficient to exercise the genius of Tacitus himself during the greatest part of his life </s>
<s> In the last years of the reign of Trajan whilst the victorious monarch extended the power of Rome beyond its ancient limits the historian was describing in the second and fourth books of his annals the tyranny of Tiberius 39 and the emperor Hadrian must have succeeded to the throne before Tacitus in the regular prosecution of his work could relate the fire of the capital and the cruelty of Nero towards the unfortunate Christians </s>
<s> At the distance of sixty years it was the duty of the annalist to adopt the narratives of contemporaries but it was natural for the philosopher to indulge himself in the description of the origin the progress and the character of the new sect not so much according to the knowledge or prejudices of the age of Nero as according to those of the time of Hadrian </s>
<s> 3 Tacitus very frequently trusts to the curiosity or reflection of his readers to supply those intermediate circumstances and ideas which in his extreme conciseness he has thought proper to suppress </s>
<s> We may therefore presume to imagine some probable cause which could direct the cruelty of Nero against the Christians of Rome whose obscurity as well as innocence should have shielded them from his indignation and even from his notice </s>
<s> The Jews who were numerous in the capital and oppressed in their own country were a much fitter object for the suspicions of the emperor and of the people nor did it seem unlikely that a vanquished nation who already discovered their abhorrence of the Roman yoke might have recourse to the most atrocious means of gratifying their implacable revenge </s>
<s> But the Jews possessed very powerful advocates in the palace and even in the heart of the tyrant his wife and mistress the beautiful Poppaea and a favorite player of the race of Abraham who had already employed their intercession in behalf of the obnoxious people </s>
<s> 40 In their room it was necessary to offer some other victims and it might easily be suggested that although the genuine followers of Moses were innocent of the fire of Rome there had arisen among them a new and pernicious sect of Galilaeans which was capable of the most horrid crimes </s>
<s> Under the appellation of Galilaeans two distinctions of men were confounded the most opposite to each other in their manners and principles the disciples who had embraced the faith of Jesus of Nazareth 41 and the zealots who had followed the standard of Judas the Gaulonite </s>
<s> 42 The former were the friends the latter were the enemies of human kind and the only resemblance between them consisted in the same inflexible constancy which in the defence of their cause rendered them insensible of death and tortures </s>
<s> The followers of Judas who impelled their countrymen into rebellion were soon buried under the ruins of Jerusalem whilst those of Jesus known by the more celebrated name of Christians diffused themselves over the Roman empire </s>
<s> How natural was it for Tacitus in the time of Hadrian to appropriate to the Christians the guilt and the sufferings which he might with far greater truth and justice have attributed to a sect whose odious memory was almost extinguished </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> Whatever opinion may be entertained of this conjecture for it is no more than a conjecture it is evident that the effect as well as the cause of Nero's persecution was confined to the walls of Rome 43 ! that the religious tenets of the Galilaeans or Christians were never made a subject of punishment or even of inquiry and that as the idea of their sufferings was for a long time connected with the idea of cruelty and injustice the moderation of succeeding princes inclined them to spare a sect oppressed by a tyrant whose rage had been usually directed against virtue and innocence </s>

<s> Could we suppose that the bishop of Carthage had employed the profession of the Christian faith only as the instrument of his avarice or ambition it was still incumbent on him to support the character he had assumed 89 and if he possessed the smallest degree of manly fortitude rather to expose himself to the most cruel tortures than by a single act to exchange the reputation of a whole life for the abhorrence of his Christian brethren and the contempt of the Gentile world </s>

<s> Although the policy of Diocletian and the humanity of Constantius inclined them to preserve inviolate the maxims of toleration it was soon discovered that their two associates Maximian and Galerius entertained the most implacable aversion for the name and religion of the Christians </s>
<s> The minds of those princes had never been enlightened by science education had never softened their temper </s>
<s> They owed their greatness to their swords and in their most elevated fortune they still retained their superstitious prejudices of soldiers and peasants </s>
<s> In the general administration of the provinces they obeyed the laws which their benefactor had established but they frequently found occasions of exercising within their camp and palaces a secret persecution 144 for which the imprudent zeal of the Christians sometimes offered the most specious pretences </s>
<s> A sentence of death was executed upon Maximilianus an African youth who had been produced by his own father before the magistrate as a sufficient and legal recruit but who obstinately persisted in declaring that his conscience would not permit him to embrace the profession of a soldier </s>
<s> 145 It could scarcely be expected that any government should suffer the action of Marcellus the Centurion to pass with impunity </s>
<s> On the day of a public festival that officer threw away his belt his arms and the ensigns of his office and exclaimed with a loud voice that he would obey none but Jesus Christ the eternal King and that he renounced forever the use of carnal weapons and the service of an idolatrous master </s>
<s> The soldiers as soon as they recovered from their astonishment secured the person of Marcellus </s>
<s> He was examined in the city of Tingi by the president of that part of Mauritania and as he was convicted by his own confession he was condemned and beheaded for the crime of desertion </s>
<s> 146 Examples of such a nature savor much less of religious persecution than of martial or even civil law but they served to alienate the mind of the emperors to justify the severity of Galerius who dismissed a great number of Christian officers from their employments and to authorize the opinion that a sect of enthusiastics which avowed principles so repugnant to the public safety must either remain useless or would soon become dangerous subjects of the empire </s>

<s> M.] After the success of the Persian war had raised the hopes and the reputation of Galerius he passed a winter with Diocletian in the palace of Nicomedia and the fate of Christianity became the object of their secret consultations </s>
<s> 147 The experienced emperor was still inclined to pursue measures of lenity and though he readily consented to exclude the Christians from holding any employments in the household or the army he urged in the strongest terms the danger as well as cruelty of shedding the blood of those deluded fanatics </s>
<s> Galerius at length extorted ! </s>
<s> from him the permission of summoning a council composed of a few persons the most distinguished in the civil and military departments of the state </s>
<s> The important question was agitated in their presence and those ambitious courtiers easily discerned that it was incumbent on them to second by their eloquence the importunate violence of the Caesar </s>
<s> It may be presumed that they insisted on every topic which might interest the pride the piety or the fears of their sovereign in the destruction of Christianity </s>
<s> Perhaps they represented that the glorious work of the deliverance of the empire was left imperfect as long as an independent people was permitted to subsist and multiply in the heart of the provinces </s>
<s> The Christians it might specially be alleged renouncing the gods and the institutions of Rome had constituted a distinct republic which might yet be suppressed before it had acquired any military force but which was already governed by its own laws and magistrates was possessed of a public treasure and was intimately connected in all its parts by the frequent assemblies of the bishops to whose decrees their numerous and opulent congregations yielded an implicit obedience </s>
<s> Arguments like these may seem to have determined the reluctant mind of Diocletian to embrace a new system of persecution but though we may suspect it is not in our power to relate the secret intrigues of the palace the private views and resentments the jealousy of women or eunuchs and all those trifling but decisive causes which so often influence the fate of empires and the councils of the wisest monarchs </s>

<s> 12 gives a very lively picture of the destruction of the church.] The next day the general edict of persecution was published 152 and though Diocletian still averse to the effusion of blood had moderated the fury of Galerius who proposed that every one refusing to offer sacrifice should immediately be burnt alive the penalties inflicted on the obstinacy of the Christians might be deemed sufficiently rigorous and effectual </s>
<s> It was enacted that their churches in all the provinces of the empire should be demolished to their foundations and the punishment of death was denounced against all who should presume to hold any secret assemblies for the purpose of religious worship </s>
<s> The philosophers who now assumed the unworthy office of directing the blind zeal of persecution had diligently studied the nature and genius of the Christian religion and as they were not ignorant that the speculative doctrines of the faith were supposed to be contained in the writings of the prophets of the evangelists and of the apostles they most probably suggested the order that the bishops and presbyters should deliver all their sacred books into the hands of the magistrates who were commanded under the severest penalties to burn them in a public and solemn manner </s>
<s> By the same edict the property of the church was at once confiscated and the several parts of which it might consist were either sold to the highest bidder united to the Imperial domain bestowed on the cities and corporations or granted to the solicitations of rapacious courtiers </s>
<s> After taking such effectual measures to abolish the worship and to dissolve the government of the Christians it was thought necessary to subject to the most intolerable hardships the condition of those perverse individuals who should still reject the religion of nature of Rome and of their ancestors </s>
<s> Persons of a liberal birth were declared incapable of holding any honors or employments slaves were forever deprived of the hopes of freedom and the whole body of the people were put out of the protection of the law </s>
<s> The judges were authorized to hear and to determine every action that was brought against a Christian </s>
<s> But the Christians were not permitted to complain of any injury which they themselves had suffered and thus those unfortunate sectaries were exposed to the severity while they were excluded from the benefits of public justice </s>
<s> This new species of martyrdom so painful and lingering so obscure and ignominious was perhaps the most proper to weary the constancy of the faithful nor can it be doubted that the passions and interest of mankind were disposed on this occasion to second the designs of the emperors </s>
<s> But the policy of a wellordered government must sometimes have interposed in behalf of the oppressed Christians nor was it possible for the Roman princes entirely to remove the apprehension of punishment or to connive at every act of fraud and violence without exposing their own authority and the rest of their subjects to the most alarming dangers </s>

<s> Within fifteen days the palace of Nicomedia and even the bedchamber of Diocletian were twice in flames and though both times they were extinguished without any material damage the singular repetition of the fire was justly considered as an evident proof that it had not been the effect of chance or negligence </s>
<s> The suspicion naturally fell on the Christians and it was suggested with some degree of probability that those desperate fanatics provoked by their present sufferings and apprehensive of impending calamities had entered into a conspiracy with their faithful brethren the eunuchs of the palace against the lives of two emperors whom they detested as the irreconcilable enemies of the church of God </s>

<s> M.] As the edict against the Christians was designed for a general law of the whole empire and as Diocletian and Galerius though they might not wait for the consent were assured of the concurrence of the Western princes it would appear more consonant to our ideas of policy that the governors of all the provinces should have received secret instructions to publish on one and the same day this declaration of war within their respective departments </s>
<s> It was at least to be expected that the convenience of the public highways and established posts would have enabled the emperors to transmit their orders with the utmost despatch from the palace of Nicomedia to the extremities of the Roman world and that they would not have suffered fifty days to elapse before the edict was published in Syria and near four months before it was signified to the cities of Africa </s>
<s> 157 This delay may perhaps be imputed to the cautious temper of Diocletian who had yielded a reluctant consent to the measures of persecution and who was desirous of trying the experiment under his more immediate eye before he gave way to the disorders and discontent which it must inevitably occasion in the distant provinces </s>
<s> At first indeed the magistrates were restrained from the effusion of blood but the use of every other severity was permitted and even recommended to their zeal nor could the Christians though they cheerfully resigned the ornaments of their churches resolve to interrupt their religious assemblies or to deliver their sacred books to the flames </s>
<s> The pious obstinacy of Felix an African bishop appears to have embarrassed the subordinate ministers of the government </s>

<s> The proconsul transmitted him to the Praetorian praefect of Italy and Felix who disdained even to give an evasive answer was at length beheaded at Venusia in Lucania a place on which the birth of Horace has conferred fame </s>
<s> 158 This precedent and perhaps some Imperial rescript which was issued in consequence of it appeared to authorize the governors of provinces in punishing with death the refusal of the Christians to deliver up their sacred books </s>
<s> There were undoubtedly many persons who embraced this opportunity of obtaining the crown of martyrdom but there were likewise too many who purchased an ignominious life by discovering and betraying the holy Scripture into the hands of infidels </s>

<s> Diocletian had no sooner published his edicts against the Christians than as if he had been desirous of committing to other hands the work of persecution he divested himself of the Imperial purple </s>
<s> The character and situation of his colleagues and successors sometimes urged them to enforce and sometimes inclined them to suspend the execution of these rigorous laws nor can we acquire a just and distinct idea of this important period of ecclesiastical history unless we separately consider the state of Christianity in the different parts of the empire during the space of ten years which elapsed between the first edicts of Diocletian and the final peace of the church </s>
<s> The mild and humane temper of Constantius was averse to the oppression of any part of his subjects </s>
<s> The principal offices of his palace were exercised by Christians </s>
<s> He loved their persons esteemed their fidelity and entertained not any dislike to their religious principles </s>
<s> But as long as Constantius remained in the subordinate station of Caesar it was not in his power openly to reject the edicts of Diocletian or to disobey the commands of Maximian </s>
<s> His authority contributed however to alleviate the sufferings which he pitied and abhorred </s>
<s> He consented with reluctance to the ruin of the churches but he ventured to protect the Christians themselves from the fury of the populace and from the rigor of the laws </s>
<s> The provinces of Gaul under which we may probably include those of Britain were indebted for the singular tranquillity which they enjoyed to the gentle interposition of their sovereign </s>
<s> 165 But Datianus the president or governor of Spain actuated either by zeal or policy chose rather to execute the public edicts of the emperors than to understand the secret intentions of Constantius and it can scarcely be doubted that his provincial administration was stained with the blood of a few martyrs </s>
<s> 166 The elevation of Constantius to the supreme and independent dignity of Augustus gave a free scope to the exercise of his virtues and the shortness of his reign did not prevent him from establishing a system of toleration of which he left the precept and the example to his son Constantine </s>
<s> His fortunate son from the first moment of his accession declaring himself the protector of the church at length deserved the appellation of the first emperor who publicly professed and established the Christian religion </s>
<s> The motives of his conversion as they may variously be deduced from benevolence from policy from conviction or from remorse and the progress of the revolution which under his powerful influence and that of his sons rendered Christianity the reigning religion of the Roman empire will form a very interesting and important chapter in the present volume of this history </s>

<s> 168 Even the conduct of Maxentius towards the bishops of Rome and Carthage may be considered as the proof of his toleration since it is probable that the most orthodox princes would adopt the same measures with regard to their established clergy </s>
<s> Marcellus the former of these prelates had thrown the capital into confusion by the severe penance which he imposed on a great number of Christians who during the late persecution had renounced or dissembled their religion </s>
<s> The rage of faction broke out in frequent and violent seditions the blood of the faithful was shed by each other's hands and the exile of Marcellus whose prudence seems to have been less eminent than his zeal was found to be the only measure capable of restoring peace to the distracted church of Rome </s>
<s> 169 The behavior of Mensurius bishop of Carthage appears to have been still more reprehensible </s>
<s> A deacon of that city had published a libel against the emperor </s>
<s> The offender took refuge in the episcopal palace and though it was somewhat early to advance any claims of ecclesiastical immunities the bishop refused to deliver him up to the officers of justice </s>
<s> For this treasonable resistance Mensurius was summoned to court and instead of receiving a legal sentence of death or banishment he was permitted after a short examination to return to his diocese </s>

<s> The vague descriptions of exile and imprisonment of pain and torture are so easily exaggerated or softened by the pencil of an artful orator that we are naturally induced to inquire into a fact of a more distinct and stubborn kind the number of persons who suffered death in consequence of the edicts published by Diocletian his associates and his successors </s>

<s> According to the distribution of Roman provinces Palestine may be considered as the sixteenth part of the Eastern empire 183 and since there were some governors who from a real or affected clemency had preserved their hands unstained with the blood of the faithful 184 it is reasonable to believe that the country which had given birth to Christianity produced at least the sixteenth part of the martyrs who suffered death within the dominions of Galerius and Maximin the whole might consequently amount to about fifteen hundred a number which if it is equally divided between the ten years of the persecution will allow an annual consumption of one hundred and fifty martyrs </s>
<s> Allotting the same proportion to the provinces of Italy Africa and perhaps Spain where at the end of two or three years the rigor of the penal laws was either suspended or abolished the multitude of Christians in the Roman empire on whom a capital punishment was inflicted by a judicia sentence will be reduced to somewhat less than two thousand persons </s>
<s> Since it cannot be doubted that the Christians were more numerous and their enemies more exasperated in the time of Diocletian than they had ever been in any former persecution this probable and moderate computation may teach us to estimate the number of primitive saints and martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the important purpose of introducing Christianity into the world </s>

<s> If we are obliged to submit our belief to the authority of Grotius it must be allowed that the number of Protestants who were executed in a single province and a single reign far exceeded that of the primitive martyrs in the space of three centuries and of the Roman empire </s>
<s> But if the improbability of the fact itself should prevail over the weight of evidence if Grotius should be convicted of exaggerating the merit and sufferings of the Reformers 186 we shall be naturally led to inquire what confidence can be placed in the doubtful and imperfect monuments of ancient credulity what degree of credit can be assigned to a courtly bishop and a passionate declaimer who under the protection of Constantine enjoyed the exclusive privilege of recording the persecutions inflicted on the Christians by the vanquished rivals or disregarded predecessors of their gracious sovereign </s>

<s> The ambition of the praefects always formidable and sometimes fatal to the masters whom they served was supported by the strength of the Praetorian bands but after those haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian and finally suppressed by Constantine the praefects who survived their fall were reduced without difficulty to the station of useful and obedient ministers </s>

<s> It has been much disputed whether his jurisdiction measured one hundred miles from the city or whether it stretched over the ten thousand provinces of Italy.] As the spirit of jealousy and ostentation prevailed in the councils of the emperors they proceeded with anxious diligence to divide the substance and to multiply the titles of power </s>
<s> The vast countries which the Roman conquerors had united under the same simple form of administration were imperceptibly crumbled into minute fragments till at length the whole empire was distributed into one hundred and sixteen provinces each of which supported an expensive and splendid establishment </s>
<s> Of these three were governed by proconsuls thirtyseven by consulars five by correctors and seventyone by presidents </s>
<s> The appellations of these magistrates were different they ranked in successive order the ensigns of and their situation from accidental circumstances might be more or less agreeable or advantageous </s>
<s> But they were all excepting only the proconsuls alike included in the class of honorable persons and they were alike intrusted during the pleasure of the prince and under the authority of the praefects or their deputies with the administration of justice and the finances in their respective districts </s>
<s> The ponderous volumes of the Codes and Pandects 113 would furnish ample materials for a minute inquiry into the system of provincial government as in the space of six centuries it was approved by the wisdom of the Roman statesmen and lawyers </s>
<s> It may be sufficient for the historian to select two singular and salutary provisions intended to restrain the abuse of authority </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> For the preservation of peace and order the governors of the provinces were armed with the sword of justice </s>
<s> They inflicted corporal punishments and they exercised in capital offences the power of life and death </s>
<s> But they were not authorized to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution or to pronounce a sentence of the mildest and most honorable kind of exile </s>
<s> These prerogatives were reserved to the praefects who alone could impose the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces </s>
<s> 114 This distinction which seems to grant the larger while it denies the smaller degree of authority was founded on a very rational motive </s>
<s> The smaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuse </s>
<s> The passions of a provincial magistrate might frequently provoke him into acts of oppression which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the subject though from a principle of prudence perhaps of humanity he might still be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood </s>
<s> It may likewise be considered that exile considerable fines or the choice of an easy death relate more particularly to the rich and the noble and the persons the most exposed to the avarice or resentment of a provincial magistrate were thus removed from his obscure persecution to the more august and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> As it was reasonably apprehended that the integrity of the judge might be biased if his interest was concerned or his affections were engaged the strictest regulations were established to exclude any person without the special dispensation of the emperor from the government of the province where he was born 115 and to prohibit the governor or his son from contracting marriage with a native or an inhabitant 116 or from purchasing slaves lands or houses within the extent of his jurisdiction </s>
<s> 117 Notwithstanding these rigorous precautions the emperor Constantine after a reign of twentyfive years still deplores the venal and oppressive administration of justice and expresses the warmest indignation that the audience of the judge his despatch of business his seasonable delays and his final sentence were publicly sold either by himself or by the officers of his court </s>
<s> The continuance and perhaps the impunity of these crimes is attested by the repetition of impotent laws and ineffectual menaces </s>

<s> 124 The influence of the revenue the authority of law and the command of a military force concurred to render their power supreme and absolute and whenever they were tempted to violate their allegiance the loyal province which they involved in their rebellion was scarcely sensible of any change in its political state </s>
<s> From the time of Commodus to the reign of Constantine near one hundred governors might be enumerated who with various success erected the standard of revolt and though the innocent were too often sacrificed the guilty might be sometimes prevented by the suspicious cruelty of their master </s>
<s> 125 To secure his throne and the public tranquillity from these formidable servants Constantine resolved to divide the military from the civil administration and to establish as a permanent and professional distinction a practice which had been adopted only as an occasional expedient </s>
<s> The supreme jurisdiction exercised by the Praetorian praefects over the armies of the empire was transferred to the two mastersgeneral whom he instituted the one for the cavalry the other for the infantry and though each of these illustrious officers was more peculiarly responsible for the discipline of those troops which were under his immediate inspection they both indifferently commanded in the field the several bodies whether of horse or foot which were united in the same army </s>
<s> 126 Their number was soon doubled by the division of the east and west and as separate generals of the same rank and title were appointed on the four important frontiers of the Rhine of the Upper and the Lower Danube and of the Euphrates the defence of the Roman empire was at length committed to eight mastersgeneral of the cavalry and infantry </s>

<s> The rivals who contended for the possession of the Roman world had withdrawn the greatest part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier and the principal cities which formed the boundary of their respective dominions were filled with soldiers who considered their countrymen as their most implacable enemies </s>
<s> After the use of these internal garrisons had ceased with the civil war the conqueror wanted either wisdom or firmness to revive the severe discipline of Diocletian and to suppress a fatal indulgence which habit had endeared and almost confirmed to the military order </s>
<s> From the reign of Constantine a popular and even legal distinction was admitted between the Palatines 128 and the Borderers the troops of the court as they were improperly styled and the troops of the frontier </s>
<s> The former elevated by the superiority of their pay and privileges were permitted except in the extraordinary emergencies of war to occupy their tranquil stations in the heart of the provinces </s>
<s> The most flourishing cities were oppressed by the intolerable weight of quarters </s>
<s> The soldiers insensibly forgot the virtues of their profession and contracted only the vices of civil life </s>
<s> They were either degraded by the industry of mechanic trades or enervated by the luxury of baths and theatres </s>
<s> They soon became careless of their martial exercises curious in their diet and apparel and while they inspired terror to the subjects of the empire they trembled at the hostile approach of the Barbarians </s>
<s> 129 The chain of fortifications which Diocletian and his colleagues had extended along the banks of the great rivers was no longer maintained with the same care or defended with the same vigilance </s>
<s> The numbers which still remained under the name of the troops of the frontier might be sufficient for the ordinary defence but their spirit was degraded by the humiliating reflection that they who were exposed to the hardships and dangers of a perpetual warfare were rewarded only with about two thirds of the pay and emoluments which were lavished on the troops of the court </s>
<s> Even the bands or legions that were raised the nearest to the level of those unworthy favorites were in some measure disgraced by the title of honor which they were allowed to assume </s>
<s> It was in vain that Constantine repeated the most dreadful menaces of fire and sword against the Borderers who should dare desert their colors to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians or to participate in the spoil </s>
<s> 130 The mischiefs which flow from injudicious counsels are seldom removed by the application of partial severities and though succeeding princes labored to restore the strength and numbers of the frontier garrisons the empire till the last moment of its dissolution continued to languish under the mortal wound which had been so rashly or so weakly inflicted by the hand of Constantine </s>

<s> The martial pride of the legions whose victorious camps had so often been the scene of rebellion was nourished by the memory of their past exploits and the consciousness of their actual strength </s>

<s> 131 From this fact and from similar examples there is reason to believe that the constitution of the legionary troops to which they partly owed their valor and discipline was dissolved by Constantine and that the bands of Roman infantry which still assumed the same names and the same honors consisted only of one thousand or fifteen hundred men </s>

<s> The introduction of Barbarians into the Roman armies became every day more universal more necessary and more fatal </s>
<s> The most daring of the Scythians of the Goths and of the Germans who delighted in war and who found it more profitable to defend than to ravage the provinces were enrolled not only in the auxiliaries of their respective nations but in the legions themselves and among the most distinguished of the Palatine troops </s>

<s> They abjured the implicit reverence which the pride of Rome had exacted from their ignorance while they acquired the knowledge and possession of those advantages by which alone she supported her declining greatness </s>
<s> The Barbarian soldiers who displayed any military talents were advanced without exception to the most important commands and the names of the tribunes of the counts and dukes and of the generals themselves betray a foreign origin which they no longer condescended to disguise </s>
<s> They were often intrusted with the conduct of a war against their countrymen and though most of them preferred the ties of allegiance to those of blood they did not always avoid the guilt or at least the suspicion of holding a treasonable correspondence with the enemy of inviting his invasion or of sparing his retreat </s>

<s> The correspondence between the prince and his subjects was managed by the four scrinia or offices of this minister of state </s>
<s> The first was appropriated to memorials the second to epistles the third to petitions and the fourth to papers and orders of a miscellaneous kind </s>
<s> Each of these was directed by an inferior master of respectable dignity and the whole business was despatched by a hundred and fortyeight secretaries chosen for the most part from the profession of the law on account of the variety of abstracts of reports and references which frequently occurred in the exercise of their several functions </s>
<s> From a condescension which in former ages would have been esteemed unworthy the Roman majesty a particular secretary was allowed for the Greek language and interpreters were appointed to receive the ambassadors of the Barbarians but the department of foreign affairs which constitutes so essential a part of modern policy seldom diverted the attention of the master of the offices </s>

<s> 148 As the orations which he composed in the name of the emperor 149 acquired the force and at length the form of absolute edicts he was considered as the representative of the legislative power the oracle of the council and the original source of the civil jurisprudence </s>
<s> He was sometimes invited to take his seat in the supreme judicature of the Imperial consistory with the Praetorian praefects and the master of the offices and he was frequently requested to resolve the doubts of inferior judges but as he was not oppressed with a variety of subordinate business his leisure and talents were employed to cultivate that dignified style of eloquence which in the corruption of taste and language still preserves the majesty of the Roman laws </s>

<s> The name and use of the indictions 170 which serve to ascertain the chronology of the middle ages were derived from the regular practice of the Roman tributes </s>
<s> 171 The emperor subscribed with his own hand and in purple ink the solemn edict or indiction which was fixed up in the principal city of each diocese during two months previous to the first day of September </s>
<s> And by a very easy connection of ideas the word indiction was transferred to the measure of tribute which it prescribed and to the annual term which it allowed for the payment </s>
<s> This general estimate of the supplies was proportioned to the real and imaginary wants of the state but as often as the expense exceeded the revenue or the revenue fell short of the computation an additional tax under the name of superindiction was imposed on the people and the most valuable attribute of sovereignty was communicated to the Praetorian praefects who on some occasions were permitted to provide for the unforeseen and extraordinary exigencies of the public service </s>
<s> The execution of these laws which it would be tedious to pursue in their minute and intricate detail consisted of two distinct operations the resolving the general imposition into its constituent parts which were assessed on the provinces the cities and the individuals of the Roman world and the collecting the separate contributions of the individuals the cities and the provinces till the accumulated sums were poured into the Imperial treasuries </s>
<s> But as the account between the monarch and the subject was perpetually open and as the renewal of the demand anticipated the perfect discharge of the preceding obligation the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the same hands round the circle of its yearly revolution </s>
<s> Whatever was honorable or important in the administration of the revenue was committed to the wisdom of the praefects and their provincia </s>
<s> representatives the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of subordinate officers some of whom depended on the treasurer others on the governor of the province and who in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed jurisdiction had frequent opportunities of disputing with each other the spoils of the people </s>
<s> The laborious offices which could be productive only of envy and reproach of expense and danger were imposed on the Decurions who formed the corporations of the cities and whom the severity of the Imperial laws had condemned to sustain the burdens of civil society </s>
<s> 172 The whole landed property of the empire without excepting the patrimonial estates of the monarch was the object of ordinary taxation and every new purchaser contracted the obligations of the former proprietor </s>
<s> An accurate census 173 or survey was the only equitable mode of ascertaining the proportion which every citizen should be obliged to contribute for the public service and from the wellknown period of the indictions there is reason to believe that this difficult and expensive operation was repeated at the regular distance of fifteen years </s>
<s> The lands were measured by surveyors who were sent into the provinces their nature whether arable or pasture or vineyards or woods was distinctly reported and an estimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years </s>
<s> The numbers of slaves and of cattle constituted an essential part of the report an oath was administered to the proprietors which bound them to disclose the true state of their affairs and their attempts to prevaricate or elude the intention of the legislator were severely watched and punished as a capital crime which included the double guilt of treason and sacrilege </s>
<s> 174 A large portion of the tribute was paid in money and of the current coin of the empire gold alone could be legally accepted </s>
<s> 175 The remainder of the taxes according to the proportions determined by the annual indiction was furnished in a manner still more direct and still more oppressive </s>
<s> According to the different nature of lands their real produce in the various articles of wine or oil corn or barley wood or iron was transported by the labor or at the expense of the provincials to the Imperial magazines from whence they were occasionally distributed for the use of the court of the army and of two capitals Rome and Constantinople </s>
<s> The commissioners of the revenue were so frequently obliged to make considerable purchases that they were strictly prohibited from allowing any compensation or from receiving in money the value of those supplies which were exacted in kind </s>
<s> In the primitive simplicity of small communities this method may be well adapted to collect the almost voluntary offerings of the people but it is at once susceptible of the utmost latitude and of the utmost strictness which in a corrupt and absolute monarchy must introduce a perpetual contest between the power of oppression and the arts of fraud </s>
<s> 176 The agriculture of the Roman provinces was insensibly ruined and in the progress of despotism which tends to disappoint its own purpose the emperors were obliged to derive some merit from the forgiveness of debts or the remission of tributes which their subjects were utterly incapable of paying </s>

<s> 178 The returns which were sent of every province or district expressed the number of tributary subjects and the amount of the public impositions </s>
<s> The latter of these sums was divided by the former and the estimate that such a province contained so many capita or heads of tribute and that each head was rated at such a price was universally received not only in the popular but even in the legal computation </s>
<s> The value of a tributary head must have varied according to many accidental or at least fluctuating circumstances but some knowledge has been preserved of a very curious fact the more important since it relates to one of the richest provinces of the Roman empire and which now flourishes as the most splendid of the European kingdoms </s>
<s> The rapacious ministers of Constantius had exhausted the wealth of Gaul by exacting twentyfive pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head </s>
<s> The humane policy of his successor reduced the capitation to seven pieces </s>

<s> In a poetical request addressed to one of the last and most deserving of the Roman princes who reigned in Gaul Sidonius Apollinaris personifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monster the Geryon of the Grecian fables and entreats the new Hercules that he would most graciously be pleased to save his life by cutting off three of his heads </s>

<s> The difficulty of allowing an annual sum of about nine pounds sterling even for the average of the capitation of Gaul may be rendered more evident by the comparison of the present state of the same country as it is now governed by the absolute monarch of an industrious wealthy and affectionate people </s>
<s> The taxes of France cannot be magnified either by fear or by flattery beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions sterling which ought perhaps to be shared among four and twenty millions of inhabitants </s>
<s> 182 Seven millions of these in the capacity of fathers or brothers or husbands may discharge the obligations of the remaining multitude of women and children yet the equal proportion of each tributary subject will scarcely rise above fifty shillings of our money instead of a proportion almost four times as considerable which was regularly imposed on their Gallic ancestors </s>
<s> The reason of this difference may be found not so much in the relative scarcity or plenty of gold and silver as in the different state of society in ancient Gaul and in modern France </s>
<s> In a country where personal freedom is the privilege of every subject the whole mass of taxes whether they are levied on property or on consumption may be fairly divided among the whole body of the nation </s>
<s> But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world were cultivated by slaves or by peasants whose dependent condition was a less rigid servitude </s>
<s> 183 In such a state the poor were maintained at the expense of the masters who enjoyed the fruits of their labor and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of those citizens who possessed the means of an honorable or at least of a decent subsistence the comparative smallness of their numbers explains and justifies the high rate of their capitation </s>
<s> The truth of this assertion may be illustrated by the following example The Aedui one of the most powerful and civilized tribes or cities of Gaul occupied an extent of territory which now contains about five hundred thousand inhabitants in the two ecclesiastical dioceses of Autun and Nevers 184 and with the probable accession of those of Chalons and Macon 185 the population would amount to eight hundred thousand souls </s>
<s> In the time of Constantine the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than twentyfive thousand heads of capitation of whom seven thousand were discharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tribute </s>
<s> 186 A just analogy would seem to countenance the opinion of an ingenious historian 187 that the free and tributary citizens did not surpass the number of half a million and if in the ordinary administration of government their annual payments may be computed at about four millions and a half of our money it would appear that although the share of each individual was four times as considerable a fourth part only of the modern taxes of France was levied on the Imperial province of Gaul </s>

<s> Eusebius and Zosimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective </s>
<s> The intermediate shades are expressed by those writers whose character or situation variously tempered the influence of their religious zeal.] The person as well as the mind of Constantine had been enriched by nature with her choices endowments </s>
<s> His stature was lofty his countenance majestic his deportment graceful his strength and activity were displayed in every manly exercise and from his earliest youth to a very advanced season of life he preserved the vigor of his constitution by a strict adherence to the domestic virtues of chastity and temperance </s>
<s> He delighted in the social intercourse of familiar conversation and though he might sometimes indulge his disposition to raillery with less reserve than was required by the severe dignity of his station the courtesy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him </s>
<s> The sincerity of his friendship has been suspected yet he showed on some occasions that he was not incapable of a warm and lasting attachment </s>
<s> The disadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a just estimate of the value of learning and the arts and sciences derived some encouragement from the munificent protection of Constantine </s>
<s> In the despatch of business his diligence was indefatigable and the active powers of his mind were almost continually exercised in reading writing or meditating in giving audiences to ambassadors and in examining the complaints of his subjects </s>
<s> Even those who censured the propriety of his measures were compelled to acknowledge that he possessed magnanimity to conceive and patience to execute the most arduous designs without being checked either by the prejudices of education or by the clamors of the multitude </s>
<s> In the field he infused his own intrepid spirit into the troops whom he conducted with the talents of a consummate general and to his abilities rather than to his fortune we may ascribe the signal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domestic foes of the republic </s>
<s> He loved glory as the reward perhaps as the motive of his labors </s>
<s> The boundless ambition which from the moment of his accepting the purple at York appears as the ruling passion of his soul may be justified by the dangers of his own situation by the character of his rivals by the consciousness of superior merit and by the prospect that his success would enable him to restore peace and order to tot the distracted empire </s>
<s> In his civil wars against Maxentius and Licinius he had engaged on his side the inclinations of the people who compared the undissembled vices of those tyrants with the spirit of wisdom and justice which seemed to direct the general tenor of the administration of Constantine </s>
<s> 2 [Footnote 2 The virtues of Constantine are collected for the most part from Eutropius and the younger Victor two sincere pagans who wrote after the extinction of his family </s>
<s> Even Zosimus and the Emperor Julian acknowledge his personal courage and military achievements.] Had Constantine fallen on the banks of the Tyber or even in the plains of Hadrianople such is the character which with a few exceptions he might have transmitted to posterity </s>
<s> But the conclusion of his reign according to the moderate and indeed tender sentence of a writer of the same age degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the most deserving of the Roman princes </s>
<s> 3 In the life of Augustus we behold the tyrant of the republic converted almost by imperceptible degrees into the father of his country and of human kind </s>
<s> In that of Constantine we may contemplate a hero who had so long inspired his subjects with love and his enemies with terror degenerating into a cruel and dissolute monarch corrupted by his fortune or raised by conquest above the necessity of dissimulation </s>
<s> The general peace which he maintained during the last fourteen years of his reign was a period of apparent splendor rather than of real prosperity and the old age of Constantine was disgraced by the opposite yet reconcilable vices of rapaciousness and prodigality </s>
<s> The accumulated treasures found in the palaces of Maxentius and Licinius were lavishly consumed the various innovations introduced by the conqueror were attended with an increasing expense the cost of his buildings his court and his festivals required an immediate and plentiful supply and the oppression of the people was the only fund which could support the magnificence of the sovereign </s>
<s> 4 His unworthy favorites enriched by the boundless liberality of their master usurped with impunity the privilege of rapine and corruption </s>
<s> 5 A secret but universal decay was felt in every part of the public administration and the emperor himself though he still retained the obedience gradually lost the esteem of his subjects </s>
<s> The dress and manners which towards the decline of life he chose to affect served only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind </s>
<s> The Asiatic pomp which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian assumed an air of softness and effeminacy in the person of Constantine </s>
<s> He is represented with false hair of various colors laboriously arranged by the skilful artists to the times a diadem of a new and more expensive fashion a profusion of gems and pearls of collars and bracelets and a variegated flowing robe of silk most curiously embroidered with flowers of gold </s>
<s> In such apparel scarcely to be excused by the youth and folly of Elagabalus we are at a loss to discover the wisdom of an aged monarch and the simplicity of a Roman veteran </s>
<s> 6 A mind thus relaxed by prosperity and indulgence was incapable of rising to that magnanimity which disdains suspicion and dares to forgive </s>
<s> The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be justified by the maxims of policy as they are taught in the schools of tyrants but an impartial narrative of the executions or rather murders which sullied the declining age of Constantine will suggest to our most candid thoughts the idea of a prince who could sacrifice without reluctance the laws of justice and the feelings of nature to the dictates either of his passions or of his interest </s>

<s> Part II </s>
<s> By the death of Crispus the inheritance of the empire seemed to devolve on the three sons of Fausta who have been already mentioned under the names of Constantine of Constantius and of Constans </s>
<s> These young princes were successively invested with the title of Caesar and the dates of their promotion may be referred to the tenth the twentieth and the thirtieth years of the reign of their father </s>
<s> 29 This conduct though it tended to multiply the future masters of the Roman world might be excused by the partiality of paternal affection but it is not so easy to understand the motives of the emperor when he endangered the safety both of his family and of his people by the unnecessary elevation of his two nephews Dalmatius and Hannibalianus </s>
<s> The former was raised by the title of Caesar to an equality with his cousins </s>
<s> In favor of the latter Constantine invented the new and singular appellation of Nobilissimus 30 to which he annexed the flattering distinction of a robe of purple and gold </s>
<s> But of the whole series of Roman princes in any age of the empire Hannibalianus alone was distinguished by the title of King a name which the subjects of Tiberius would have detested as the profane and cruel insult of capricious tyranny </s>
<s> The use of such a title even as it appears under the reign of Constantine is a strange and unconnected fact which can scarcely be admitted on the joint authority of Imperial medals and contemporary writers </s>

<s> M.] The whole empire was deeply interested in the education of these five youths the acknowledged successors of Constantine </s>
<s> The exercise of the body prepared them for the fatigues of war and the duties of active life </s>
<s> Those who occasionally mention the education or talents of Constantius allow that he excelled in the gymnastic arts of leaping and running that he was a dexterous archer a skilful horseman and a master of all the different weapons used in the service either of the cavalry or of the infantry </s>
<s> 32 The same assiduous cultivation was bestowed though not perhaps with equal success to improve the minds of the sons and nephews of Constantine </s>
<s> 33 The most celebrated professors of the Christian faith of the Grecian philosophy and of the Roman jurisprudence were invited by the liberality of the emperor who reserved for himself the important task of instructing the royal youths in the science of government and the knowledge of mankind </s>
<s> But the genius of Constantine himself had been formed by adversity and experience </s>
<s> In the free intercourse of private life and amidst the dangers of the court of Galerius he had learned to command his own passions to encounter those of his equals and to depend for his present safety and future greatness on the prudence and firmness of his personal conduct </s>
<s> His destined successors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the imperial purple </s>
<s> Incessantly surrounded with a train of flatterers they passed their youth in the enjoyment of luxury and the expectation of a throne nor would the dignity of their rank permit them to descend from that elevated station from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a smooth and uniform aspect </s>
<s> The indulgence of Constantine admitted them at a very tender age to share the administration of the empire and they studied the art of reigning at the expense of the people intrusted to their care </s>
<s> The younger Constantine was appointed to hold his court in Gaul and his brother Constantius exchanged that department the ancient patrimony of their father for the more opulent but less martial countries of the East </s>
<s> Italy the Western Illyricum and Africa were accustomed to revere Constans the third of his sons as the representative of the great Constantine </s>
<s> He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier to which he annexed the government of Thrace Macedonia and Greece </s>
<s> The city of Caesarea was chosen for the residence of Hannibalianus and the provinces of Pontus Cappadocia and the Lesser Armenia were destined to form the extent of his new kingdom </s>
<s> For each of these princes a suitable establishment was provided </s>
<s> A just proportion of guards of legions and of auxiliaries was allotted for their respective dignity and defence </s>
<s> The ministers and generals who were placed about their persons were such as Constantine could trust to assist and even to control these youthful sovereigns in the exercise of their delegated power </s>
<s> As they advanced in years and experience the limits of their authority were insensibly enlarged but the emperor always reserved for himself the title of Augustus and while he showed the Caesars to the armies and provinces he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its supreme head </s>
<s> 34 The tranquillity of the last fourteen years of his reign was scarcely interrupted by the contemptible insurrection of a cameldriver in the Island of Cyprus 35 or by the active part which the policy of Constantine engaged him to assume in the wars of the Goths and Sarmatians </s>

<s> The military strength of the nation was composed of cavalry and the custom of their warriors to lead in their hand one or two spare horses enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence which surprised the security and eluded the pursuit of a distant enemy </s>
<s> 37 Their poverty of iron prompted their rude industry to invent a sort of cuirass which was capable of resisting a sword or javelin though it was formed only of horses' hoofs cut into thin and polished slices carefully laid over each other in the manner of scales or feathers and strongly sewed upon an under garment of coarse linen </s>
<s> 38 The offensive arms of the Sarmatians were short daggers long lances and a weighty bow vow with a quiver of arrows </s>
<s> They were reduced to the necessity of employing fish bones for the points of their weapons but the custom of dipping them in a venomous liquor that poisoned the wounds which they inflicted is alone sufficient to prove the most savage manners since a people impressed with a sense of humanity would have abhorred so cruel a practice and a nation skilled in the arts of war would have disdained so impotent a resource </s>
<s> 39 Whenever these Barbarians issued from their deserts in quest of prey their shaggy beards uncombed locks the furs with which they were covered from head to foot and their fierce countenances which seemed to express the innate cruelty of their minds inspired the more civilized provincials of Rome with horror and dismay </s>

<s> 41 In this advantageous position they watched or suspended the moment of attack as they were provoked by injuries or appeased by presents they gradually acquired the skill of using more dangerous weapons and although the Sarmatians did not illustrate their name by any memorable exploits they occasionally assisted their eastern and western neighbors the Goths and the Germans with a formidable body of cavalry </s>

<s> In the space of twelve years Nisibis which since the time of Lucullus had been deservedly esteemed the bulwark of the East sustained three memorable sieges against the power of Sapor and the disappointed monarch after urging his attacks above sixty eighty and a hundred days was thrice repulsed with loss and ignominy </s>
<s> 63 This large and populous city was situate about two days' journey from the Tigris in the midst of a pleasant and fertile plain at the foot of Mount Masius </s>
<s> A treble enclosure of brick walls was defended by a deep ditch 64 and the intrepid resistance of Count Lucilianus and his garrison was seconded by the desperate courage of the people </s>
<s> The citizens of Nisibis were animated by the exhortations of their bishop 65 inured to arms by the presence of danger and convinced of the intentions of Sapor to plant a Persian colony in their room and to lead them away into distant and barbarous captivity </s>
<s> The event of the two former sieges elated their confidence and exasperated the haughty spirit of the Great King who advanced a third time towards Nisibis at the head of the united forces of Persia and India </s>
<s> The ordinary machines invented to batter or undermine the walls were rendered ineffectual by the superior skill of the Romans and many days had vainly elapsed when Sapor embraced a resolution worthy of an eastern monarch who believed that the elements themselves were subject to his power </s>
<s> At the stated season of the melting of the snows in Armenia the River Mygdonius which divides the plain and the city of Nisibis forms like the Nile 66 an inundation over the adjacent country </s>
<s> By the labor of the Persians the course of the river was stopped below the town and the waters were confined on every side by solid mounds of earth </s>
<s> On this artificial lake a fleet of armed vessels filled with soldiers and with engines which discharged stones of five hundred pounds weight advanced in order of battle and engaged almost upon a level the troops which defended the ramparts </s>
<s> The irresistible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties till at length a portion of the walls unable to sustain the accumulated pressure gave way at once and exposed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet </s>
<s> The Persians were instantly driven to the assault and the fate of Nisibis depended on the event of the day </s>
<s> The heavyarmed cavalry who led the van of a deep column were embarrassed in the mud and great numbers were drowned in the unseen holes which had been filled by the rushing waters </s>
<s> The elephants made furious by their wounds increased the disorder and trampled down thousands of the Persian archers </s>
<s> The Great King who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms sounded with reluctant indignation the signal of the retreat and suspended for some hours the prosecution of the attack </s>
<s> But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night and the return of day discovered a new wall of six feet in height rising every moment to fill up the interval of the breach </s>
<s> Notwithstanding the disappointment of his hopes and the loss of more than twenty thousand men Sapor still pressed the reduction of Nisibis with an obstinate firmness which could have yielded only to the necessity of defending the eastern provinces of Persia against a formidable invasion of the Massagetae </s>
<s> 67 Alarmed by this intelligence he hastily relinquished the siege and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the Tigris to those of the Oxus </s>
<s> The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war engaged him soon afterwards to conclude or at least to observe a truce with the Roman emperor which was equally grateful to both princes as Constantius himself after the death of his two brothers was involved by the revolutions of the West in a civil contest which required and seemed to exceed the most vigorous exertion of his undivided strength </s>

<s> The fate of Constans himself was delayed about ten years longer and the revenge of his brother's death was reserved for the more ignoble hand of a domestic traitor </s>
<s> The pernicious tendency of the system introduced by Constantine was displayed in the feeble administration of his sons who by their vices and weakness soon lost the esteem and affections of their people </s>
<s> The pride assumed by Constans from the unmerited success of his arms was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application </s>
<s> His fond partiality towards some German captives distinguished only by the charms of youth was an object of scandal to the people 69 and Magnentius an ambitious soldier who was himself of Barbarian extraction was encouraged by the public discontent to assert the honor of the Roman name </s>
<s> 70 The chosen bands of Jovians and Herculians who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader maintained the most respectable and important station in the Imperial camp </s>
<s> The friendship of Marcellinus count of the sacred largesses supplied with a liberal hand the means of seduction </s>
<s> The soldiers were convinced by the most specious arguments that the republic summoned them to break the bonds of hereditary servitude and by the choice of an active and vigilant prince to reward the same virtues which had raised the ancestors of the degenerate Constans from a private condition to the throne of the world </s>
<s> As soon as the conspiracy was ripe for execution Marcellinus under the pretence of celebrating his son's birthday gave a splendid entertainment to the illustrious and honorable persons of the court of Gaul which then resided in the city of Autun </s>
<s> The intemperance of the feast was artfully protracted till a very late hour of the night and the unsuspecting guests were tempted to indulge themselves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of conversation </s>
<s> On a sudden the doors were thrown open and Magnentius who had retired for a few moments returned into the apartment invested with the diadem and purple </s>
<s> The conspirators instantly saluted him with the titles of Augustus and Emperor </s>
<s> The surprise the terror the intoxication the ambitious hopes and the mutual ignorance of the rest of the assembly prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation </s>
<s> The guards hastened to take the oath of fidelity the gates of the town were shut and before the dawn of day Magnentius became master of the troops and treasure of the palace and city of Autun </s>
<s> By his secrecy and diligence he entertained some hopes of surprising the person of Constans who was pursuing in the adjacent forest his favorite amusement of hunting or perhaps some pleasures of a more private and criminal nature </s>
<s> The rapid progress of fame allowed him however an instant for flight though the desertion of his soldiers and subjects deprived him of the power of resistance </s>

<s> 13 and the Abbreviators.] As soon as the death of Constans had decided this easy but important revolution the example of the court of Autun was imitated by the provinces of the West </s>
<s> The authority of Magnentius was acknowledged through the whole extent of the two great praefectures of Gaul and Italy and the usurper prepared by every act of oppression to collect a treasure which might discharge the obligation of an immense donative and supply the expenses of a civil war </s>
<s> The martial countries of Illyricum from the Danube to the extremity of Greece had long obeyed the government of Vetranio an aged general beloved for the simplicity of his manners and who had acquired some reputation by his experience and services in war </s>
<s> 73 Attached by habit by duty and by gratitude to the house of Constantine he immediately gave the strongest assurances to the only surviving son of his late master that he would expose with unshaken fidelity his person and his troops to inflict a just revenge on the traitors of Gaul </s>
<s> But the legions of Vetranio were seduced rather than provoked by the example of rebellion their leader soon betrayed a want of firmness or a want of sincerity and his ambition derived a specious pretence from the approbation of the princess Constantina </s>
<s> That cruel and aspiring woman who had obtained from the great Constantine her father the rank of Augusta placed the diadem with her own hands on the head of the Illyrian general and seemed to expect from his victory the accomplishment of those unbounded hopes of which she had been disappointed by the death of her husband Hannibalianus </s>
<s> Perhaps it was without the consent of Constantina that the new emperor formed a necessary though dishonorable alliance with the usurper of the West whose purple was so recently stained with her brother's blood </s>
<s> 74 [Footnote 73 Eutropius x </s>
<s> 10 describes Vetranio with more temper and probably with more truth than either of the two Victors </s>
<s> Vetranio was born of obscure parents in the wildest parts of Maesia and so much had his education been neglected that after his elevation he studied the alphabet.] [Footnote 74 The doubtful fluctuating conduct of Vetranio is described by Julian in his first oration and accurately explained by Spanheim who discusses the situation and behavior of Constantina.] The intelligence of these important events which so deeply affected the honor and safety of the Imperial house recalled the arms of Constantius from the inglorious prosecution of the Persian war </s>
<s> He recommended the care of the East to his lieutenants and afterwards to his cousin Gallus whom he raised from a prison to a throne and marched towards Europe with a mind agitated by the conflict of hope and fear of grief and indignation </s>
<s> On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace the emperor gave audience to the ambassadors of Magnentius and Vetranio </s>
<s> The first author of the conspiracy Marcellinus who in some measure had bestowed the purple on his new master boldly accepted this dangerous commission and his three colleagues were selected from the illustrious personages of the state and army </s>
<s> These deputies were instructed to soothe the resentment and to alarm the fears of Constantius </s>
<s> They were empowered to offer him the friendship and alliance of the western princes to cement their union by a double marriage of Constantius with the daughter of Magnentius and of Magnentius himself with the ambitious Constantina and to acknowledge in the treaty the preeminence of rank which might justly be claimed by the emperor of the East </s>
<s> Should pride and mistaken piety urge him to refuse these equitable conditions the ambassadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which must attend his rashness if he ventured to provoke the sovereigns of the West to exert their superior strength and to employ against him that valor those abilities and those legions to which the house of Constantine had been indebted for so many triumphs </s>
<s> Such propositions and such arguments appeared to deserve the most serious attention the answer of Constantius was deferred till the next day and as he had reflected on the importance of justifying a civil war in the opinion of the people he thus addressed his council who listened with real or affected credulity Last night said he after I retired to rest the shade of the great Constantine embracing the corpse of my murdered brother rose before my eyes his wellknown voice awakened me to revenge forbade me to despair of the republic and assured me of the success and immortal glory which would crown the justice of my arms </s>
<s> The authority of such a vision or rather of the prince who alleged it silenced every doubt and excluded all negotiation </s>
<s> The ignominious terms of peace were rejected with disdain </s>
<s> One of the ambassadors of the tyrant was dismissed with the haughty answer of Constantius his colleagues as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations were put in irons and the contending powers prepared to wage an implacable war </s>
<s> 75 [Footnote 75 See Peter the Patrician in the Excerpta Legationem p </s>
<s> 27.] Such was the conduct and such perhaps was the duty of the brother of Constans towards the perfidious usurper of Gaul </s>
<s> The situation and character of Vetranio admitted of milder measures and the policy of the Eastern emperor was directed to disunite his antagonists and to separate the forces of Illyricum from the cause of rebellion </s>
<s> It was an easy task to deceive the frankness and simplicity of Vetranio who fluctuating some time between the opposite views of honor and interest displayed to the world the insincerity of his temper and was insensibly engaged in the snares of an artful negotiation </s>
<s> Constantius acknowledged him as a legitimate and equal colleague in the empire on condition that he would renounce his disgraceful alliance with Magnentius and appoint a place of interview on the frontiers of their respective provinces where they might pledge their friendship by mutual vows of fidelity and regulate by common consent the future operations of the civil war </s>
<s> In consequence of this agreement Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica 76 at the head of twenty thousand horse and of a more numerous body of infantry a power so far superior to the forces of Constantius that the Illyrian emperor appeared to command the life and fortunes of his rival who depending on the success of his private negotiations had seduced the troops and undermined the throne of Vetranio </s>
<s> The chiefs who had secretly embraced the party of Constantius prepared in his favor a public spectacle calculated to discover and inflame the passions of the multitude </s>
<s> 77 The united armies were commanded to assemble in a large plain near the city </s>
<s> In the centre according to the rules of ancient discipline a military tribunal or rather scaffold was erected from whence the emperors were accustomed on solemn and important occasions to harangue the troops </s>
<s> The wellordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians with drawn swords or with erected spears the squadrons of cavalry and the cohorts of infantry distinguished by the variety of their arms and ensigns formed an immense circle round the tribunal and the attentive silence which they preserved was sometimes interrupted by loud bursts of clamor or of applause </s>
<s> In the presence of this formidable assembly the two emperors were called upon to explain the situation of public affairs the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Constantius and though he was indifferently skilled in the arts of rhetoric he acquitted himself under these difficult circumstances with firmness dexterity and eloquence </s>
<s> The first part of his oration seemed to be pointed only against the tyrant of Gaul but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Constans he insinuated that none except a brother could claim a right to the succession of his brother </s>
<s> He displayed with some complacency the glories of his Imperial race and recalled to the memory of the troops the valor the triumphs the liberality of the great Constantine to whose sons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity which the ingratitude of his most favored servants had tempted them to violate </s>
<s> The officers who surrounded the tribunal and were instructed to act their part in this extraordinary scene confessed the irresistible power of reason and eloquence by saluting the emperor Constantius as their lawful sovereign </s>
<s> The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank till the plain of Sardica resounded with the universal acclamation of Away with these upstart usurpers </s>
<s> Long life and victory to the son of Constantine </s>
<s> Under his banners alone we will fight and conquer </s>
<s> The shout of thousands their menacing gestures the fierce clashing of their arms astonished and subdued the courage of Vetranio who stood amidst the defection of his followers in anxious and silent suspense </s>
<s> Instead of embracing the last refuge of generous despair he tamely submitted to his fate and taking the diadem from his head in the view of both armies fell prostrate at the feet of his conqueror </s>
<s> Constantius used his victory with prudence and moderation and raising from the ground the aged suppliant whom he affected to style by the endearing name of Father he gave him his hand to descend from the throne </s>
<s> The city of Prusa was assigned for the exile or retirement of the abdicated monarch who lived six years in the enjoyment of ease and affluence </s>
<s> He often expressed his grateful sense of the goodness of Constantius and with a very amiable simplicity advised his benefactor to resign the sceptre of the world and to seek for content where alone it could be found in the peaceful obscurity of a private condition </s>

<s> 79 The approaching contest with Magnentius was of a more serious and bloody kind </s>

<s> The fertile plains 80 of the Lower Pannonia between the Drave the Save and the Danube presented a spacious theatre and the operations of the civil war were protracted during the summer months by the skill or timidity of the combatants </s>
<s> 81 Constantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis a name that would animate his troops by the remembrance of the victory which on the same auspicious ground had been obtained by the arms of his father Constantine </s>
<s> Yet by the impregnable fortifications with which the emperor encompassed his camp he appeared to decline rather than to invite a general engagement </s>
<s> It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to compel his adversary to relinquish this advantageous position and he employed with that view the various marches evolutions and stratagems which the knowledge of the art of war could suggest to an experienced officer </s>
<s> He carried by assault the important town of Siscia made an attack on the city of Sirmium which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp attempted to force a passage over the Save into the eastern provinces of Illyricum and cut in pieces a numerous detachment which he had allured into the narrow passes of Adarne </s>
<s> During the greater part of the summer the tyrant of Gaul showed himself master of the field </s>
<s> The troops of Constantius were harassed and dispirited his reputation declined in the eye of the world and his pride condescended to solicit a treaty of peace which would have resigned to the assassin of Constans the sovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps </s>
<s> These offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip the Imperial ambassador and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were disposed to accept them </s>
<s> But the haughty usurper careless of the remonstrances of his friends gave orders that Philip should be detained as a captive or at least as a hostage while he despatched an officer to reproach Constantius with the weakness of his reign and to insult him by the promise of a pardon if he would instantly abdicate the purple </s>
<s> That he should confide in the justice of his cause and the protection of an avenging Deity was the only answer which honor permitted the emperor to return </s>
<s> But he was so sensible of the difficulties of his situation that he no longer dared to retaliate the indignity which had been offered to his representative </s>

<s> Magnentius directing his march towards Mursa set fire to the gates and by a sudden assault had almost scaled the walls of the town </s>
<s> The vigilance of the garrison extinguished the flames the approach of Constantius left him no time to continue the operations of the siege and the emperor soon removed the only obstacle that could embarrass his motions by forcing a body of troops which had taken post in an adjoining amphitheatre </s>

<s> 83 The troops on both sides remained under arms in anxious expectation during the greatest part of the morning and the son of Constantine after animating his soldiers by an eloquent speech retired into a church at some distance from the field of battle and committed to his generals the conduct of this decisive day </s>

<s> 67 The precepts of eloquence which he had hitherto practised on fancied topics of declamation were more usefully applied to excite or to assuage the passions of an armed multitude and although Julian from his early habits of conversation and literature was more familiarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language he had attained a competent knowledge of the Latin tongue </s>

<s> The villages on either side of the Meyn which were plentifully stored with corn and cattle felt the ravages of an invading army </s>
<s> The principal houses constructed with some imitation of Roman elegance were consumed by the flames and the Caesar boldly advanced about ten miles till his progress was stopped by a dark and impenetrable forest undermined by subterraneous passages which threatened with secret snares and ambush every step of the assailants </s>
<s> The ground was already covered with snow and Julian after repairing an ancient castle which had been erected by Trajan granted a truce of ten months to the submissive Barbarians </s>
<s> At the expiration of the truce Julian undertook a second expedition beyond the Rhine to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire two of the kings of the Alemanni who had been present at the battle of Strasburgh </s>
<s> They promised to restore all the Roman captives who yet remained alive and as the Caesar had procured an exact account from the cities and villages of Gaul of the inhabitants whom they had lost he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readiness and accuracy which almost established the belief of his supernatural knowledge </s>
<s> His third expedition was still more splendid and important than the two former </s>
<s> The Germans had collected their military powers and moved along the opposite banks of the river with a design of destroying the bridge and of preventing the passage of the Romans </s>
<s> But this judicious plan of defence was disconcerted by a skilful diversion </s>
<s> Three hundred lightarmed and active soldiers were detached in forty small boats to fall down the stream in silence and to land at some distance from the posts of the enemy </s>
<s> They executed their orders with so much boldness and celerity that they had almost surprised the Barbarian chiefs who returned in the fearless confidence of intoxication from one of their nocturnal festivals </s>
<s> Without repeating the uniform and disgusting tale of slaughter and devastation it is sufficient to observe that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to six of the haughtiest kings of the Alemanni three of whom were permitted to view the severe discipline and martial pomp of a Roman camp </s>

<s> The active zeal of Julian urged the prosecution of the work and such was the spirit which he had diffused among the troops that the auxiliaries themselves waiving their exemption from any duties of fatigue contended in the most servile labors with the diligence of the Roman soldiers </s>

<s> The desertion of the former and the mutiny of the latter must have been the fatal and inevitable consequences of famine </s>

<s> And who replied Julian will ever be innocent if it be sufficient to affirm </s>
<s> In the general administration of peace and war the interest of the sovereign is commonly the same as that of his people but Constantius would have thought himself deeply injured if the virtues of Julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppressed and exhausted country </s>
<s> The prince who was invested with the ensigns of royalty might sometimes presume to correct the rapacious insolence of his inferior agents to expose their corrupt arts and to introduce an equal and easier mode of collection </s>
<s> But the management of the finances was more safely intrusted to Florentius praetorian praefect of Gaul an effeminate tyrant incapable of pity or remorse and the haughty minister complained of the most decent and gentle opposition while Julian himself was rather inclined to censure the weakness of his own behavior </s>
<s> The Caesar had rejected with abhorrence a mandate for the levy of an extraordinary tax a new superindiction which the praefect had offered for his signature and the faithful picture of the public misery by which he had been obliged to justify his refusal offended the court of Constantius </s>

<s> 90 The precarious and dependent situation of Julian displayed his virtues and concealed his defects </s>

<s> The victories and the civil policy of Constantine no longer influence the state of Europe but a considerable portion of the globe still retains the impression which it received from the conversion of that monarch and the ecclesiastical institutions of his reign are still connected by an indissoluble chain with the opinions the passions and the interests of the present generation </s>
<s> In the consideration of a subject which may be examined with impartiality but cannot be viewed with indifference a difficulty immediately arises of a very unexpected nature that of ascertaining the real and precise date of the conversion of Constantine </s>
<s> The eloquent Lactantius in the midst of his court seems impatient 1 to proclaim to the world the glorious example of the sovereign of Gaul who in the first moments of his reign acknowledged and adored the majesty of the true and only God </s>
<s> 2 The learned Eusebius has ascribed the faith of Constantine to the miraculous sign which was displayed in the heavens whilst he meditated and prepared the Italian expedition </s>
<s> 3 The historian Zosimus maliciously asserts that the emperor had imbrued his hands in the blood of his eldest son before he publicly renounced the gods of Rome and of his ancestors </s>
<s> 4 The perplexity produced by these discordant authorities is derived from the behavior of Constantine himself </s>
<s> According to the strictness of ecclesiastical language the first of the Christian emperors was unworthy of that name till the moment of his death since it was only during his last illness that he received as a catechumen the imposition of hands 5 and was afterwards admitted by the initiatory rites of baptism into the number of the faithful </s>
<s> 6 The Christianity of Constantine must be allowed in a much more vague and qualified sense and the nicest accuracy is required in tracing the slow and almost imperceptible gradations by which the monarch declared himself the protector and at length the proselyte of the church </s>
<s> It was an arduous task to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education to acknowledge the divine power of Christ and to understand that the truth of his revelation was incompatible with the worship of the gods </s>
<s> The obstacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind instructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion and he insensibly discovered his new opinions as far as he could enforce them with safety and with effect </s>
<s> During the whole course of his reign the stream of Christianity flowed with a gentle though accelerated motion but its general direction was sometimes checked and sometimes diverted by the accidental circumstances of the times and by the prudence or possibly by the caprice of the monarch </s>
<s> His ministers were permitted to signify the intentions of their master in the various language which was best adapted to their respective principles 7 and he artfully balanced the hopes and fears of his subjects by publishing in the same year two edicts the first of which enjoined the solemn observance of Sunday 8 and the second directed the regular consultation of the Aruspices </s>
<s> 9 While this important revolution yet remained in suspense the Christians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their sovereign with the same anxiety but with very opposite sentiments </s>
<s> The former were prompted by every motive of zeal as well as vanity to exaggerate the marks of his favor and the evidences of his faith </s>
<s> The latter till their just apprehensions were changed into despair and resentment attempted to conceal from the world and from themselves that the gods of Rome could no longer reckon the emperor in the number of their votaries </s>
<s> The same passions and prejudices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profession of Christianity with the most glorious or the most ignominious aera of the reign of Constantine </s>

<s> In the personal interview of the two western princes Constantine by the ascendant of genius and power obtained the ready concurrence of his colleague Licinius the union of their names and authority disarmed the fury of Maximin and after the death of the tyrant of the East the edict of Milan was received as a general and fundamental law of the Roman world </s>

<s> It was enacted that the places of worship and public lands which had been confiscated should be restored to the church without dispute without delay and without expense and this severe injunction was accompanied with a gracious promise that if any of the purchasers had paid a fair and adequate price they should be indemnified from the Imperial treasury </s>
<s> The salutary regulations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration and such an equality must have been interpreted by a recent sect as an advantageous and honorable distinction </s>
<s> The two emperors proclaim to the world that they have granted a free and absolute power to the Christians and to all others of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer to which he has addicted his mind and which he may deem the best adapted to his own use </s>
<s> They carefully explain every ambiguous word remove every exception and exact from the governors of the provinces a strict obedience to the true and simple meaning of an edict which was designed to establish and secure without any limitation the claims of religious liberty </s>
<s> They condescend to assign two weighty reasons which have induced them to allow this universal toleration the humane intention of consulting the peace and happiness of their people and the pious hope that by such a conduct they shall appease and propitiate the Deity whose seat is in heaven </s>
<s> They gratefully acknowledge the many signal proofs which they have received of the divine favor and they trust that the same Providence will forever continue to protect the prosperity of the prince and people </s>
<s> From these vague and indefinite expressions of piety three suppositions may be deduced of a different but not of an incompatible nature </s>
<s> The mind of Constantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Christian religions </s>
<s> According to the loose and complying notions of Polytheism he might acknowledge the God of the Christians as one of the many deities who compose the hierarchy of heaven </s>
<s> Or perhaps he might embrace the philosophic and pleasing idea that notwithstanding the variety of names of rites and of opinions all the sects and all the nations of mankind are united in the worship of the common Father and Creator of the universe </s>

<s> The partial and increasing favor of Constantine may naturally be referred to the esteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Christians and to a persuasion that the propagation of the gospel would inculcate the practice of private and public virtue </s>
<s> Whatever latitude an absolute monarch may assume in his own conduct whatever indulgence he may claim for his own passions it is undoubtedly his interest that all his subjects should respect the natural and civil obligations of society </s>
<s> But the operation of the wisest laws is imperfect and precarious </s>
<s> They seldom inspire virtue they cannot always restrain vice </s>
<s> Their power is insufficient to prohibit all that they condemn nor can they always punish the actions which they prohibit </s>
<s> The legislators of antiquity had summoned to their aid the powers of education and of opinion </s>
<s> But every principle which had once maintained the vigor and purity of Rome and Sparta was long since extinguished in a declining and despotic empire </s>
<s> Philosophy still exercised her temperate sway over the human mind but the cause of virtue derived very feeble support from the influence of the Pagan superstition </s>
<s> Under these discouraging circumstances a prudent magistrate might observe with pleasure the progress of a religion which diffused among the people a pure benevolent and universal system of ethics adapted to every duty and every condition of life recommended as the will and reason of the supreme Deity and enforced by the sanction of eternal rewards or punishments </s>
<s> The experience of Greek and Roman history could not inform the world how far the system of national manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation and Constantine might listen with some confidence to the flattering and indeed reasonable assurances of Lactantius </s>
<s> The eloquent apologist seemed firmly to expect and almost ventured to promise that the establishment of Christianity would restore the innocence and felicity of the primitive age that the worship of the true God would extinguish war and dissension among those who mutually considered themselves as the children of a common parent that every impure desire every angry or selfish passion would be restrained by the knowledge of the gospel and that the magistrates might sheath the sword of justice among a people who would be universally actuated by the sentiments of truth and piety of equity and moderation of harmony and universal love </s>

<s> To the Deity alone he was accountable for the abuse of his power and his subjects were indissolubly bound by their oath of fidelity to a tyrant who had violated every law of nature and society </s>
<s> The humble Christians were sent into the world as sheep among wolves and since they were not permitted to employ force even in the defence of their religion they should be still more criminal if they were tempted to shed the blood of their fellowcreatures in disputing the vain privileges or the sordid possessions of this transitory life </s>
<s> Faithful to the doctrine of the apostle who in the reign of Nero had preached the duty of unconditional submission the Christians of the three first centuries preserved their conscience pure and innocent of the guilt of secret conspiracy or open rebellion </s>
<s> While they experienced the rigor of persecution they were never provoked either to meet their tyrants in the field or indignantly to withdraw themselves into some remote and sequestered corner of the globe </s>
<s> 19 The Protestants of France of Germany and of Britain who asserted with such intrepid courage their civil and religious freedom have been insulted by the invidious comparison between the conduct of the primitive and of the reformed Christians </s>
<s> 20 Perhaps instead of censure some applause may be due to the superior sense and spirit of our ancestors who had convinced themselves that religion cannot abolish the unalienable rights of human nature </s>

<s> A sect of unwarlike plebeians without leaders without arms without fortifications must have encountered inevitable destruction in a rash and fruitless resistance to the master of the Roman legions </s>

<s> Part II </s>
<s> The assurance that the elevation of Constantine was intimately connected with the designs of Providence instilled into the minds of the Christians two opinions which by very different means assisted the accomplishment of the prophecy </s>
<s> Their warm and active loyalty exhausted in his favor every resource of human industry and they confidently expected that their strenuous efforts would be seconded by some divine and miraculous aid </s>
<s> The enemies of Constantine have imputed to interested motives the alliance which he insensibly contracted with the Catholic church and which apparently contributed to the success of his ambition </s>
<s> In the beginning of the fourth century the Christians still bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire but among a degenerate people who viewed the change of masters with the indifference of slaves the spirit and union of a religious party might assist the popular leader to whose service from a principle of conscience they had devoted their lives and fortunes </s>
<s> 25 The example of his father had instructed Constantine to esteem and to reward the merit of the Christians and in the distribution of public offices he had the advantage of strengthening his government by the choice of ministers or generals in whose fidelity he could repose a just and unreserved confidence </s>
<s> By the influence of these dignified missionaries the proselytes of the new faith must have multiplied in the court and army the Barbarians of Germany who filled the ranks of the legions were of a careless temper which acquiesced without resistance in the religion of their commander and when they passed the Alps it may fairly be presumed that a great number of the soldiers had already consecrated their swords to the service of Christ and of Constantine </s>
<s> 26 The habits of mankind and the interests of religion gradually abated the horror of war and bloodshed which had so long prevailed among the Christians and in the councils which were assembled under the gracious protection of Constantine the authority of the bishops was seasonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on those soldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church </s>
<s> 27 While Constantine in his own dominions increased the number and zeal of his faithful adherents he could depend on the support of a powerful faction in those provinces which were still possessed or usurped by his rivals </s>
<s> A secret disaffection was diffused among the Christian subjects of Maxentius and Licinius and the resentment which the latter did not attempt to conceal served only to engage them still more deeply in the interest of his competitor </s>
<s> The regular correspondence which connected the bishops of the most distant provinces enabled them freely to communicate their wishes and their designs and to transmit without danger any useful intelligence or any pious contributions which might promote the service of Constantine who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deliverance of the church </s>

<s> They marched to battle with the full assurance that the same God who had formerly opened a passage to the Israelites through the waters of Jordan and had thrown down the walls of Jericho at the sound of the trumpets of Joshua would display his visible majesty and power in the victory of Constantine </s>
<s> The evidence of ecclesiastical history is prepared to affirm that their expectations were justified by the conspicuous miracle to which the conversion of the first Christian emperor has been almost unanimously ascribed </s>
<s> The real or imaginary cause of so important an event deserves and demands the attention of posterity and I shall endeavor to form a just estimate of the famous vision of Constantine by a distinct consideration of the standard the dream and the celestial sign by separating the historical the natural and the marvellous parts of this extraordinary story which in the composition of a specious argument have been artfully confounded in one splendid and brittle mass </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> An instrument of the tortures which were inflicted only on slaves and strangers became on object of horror in the eyes of a Roman citizen and the ideas of guilt of pain and of ignominy were closely united with the idea of the cross </s>
<s> 29 The piety rather than the humanity of Constantine soon abolished in his dominions the punishment which the Savior of mankind had condescended to suffer 30 but the emperor had already learned to despise the prejudices of his education and of his people before he could erect in the midst of Rome his own statue bearing a cross in its right hand with an inscription which referred the victory of his arms and the deliverance of Rome to the virtue of that salutary sign the true symbol of force and courage </s>
<s> 31 The same symbol sanctified the arms of the soldiers of Constantine the cross glittered on their helmet was engraved on their shields was interwoven into their banners and the consecrated emblems which adorned the person of the emperor himself were distinguished only by richer materials and more exquisite workmanship </s>
<s> 32 But the principal standard which displayed the triumph of the cross was styled the Labarum 33 an obscure though celebrated name which has been vainly derived from almost all the languages of the world </s>
<s> It is described 34 as a long pike intersected by a transversal beam </s>
<s> The silken veil which hung down from the beam was curiously inwrought with the images of the reigning monarch and his children </s>
<s> The summit of the pike supported a crown of gold which enclosed the mysterious monogram at once expressive of the figure of the cross and the initial letters of the name of Christ </s>
<s> 35 The safety of the labarum was intrusted to fifty guards of approved valor and fidelity their station was marked by honors and emoluments and some fortunate accidents soon introduced an opinion that as long as the guards of the labarum were engaged in the execution of their office they were secure and invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy </s>

<s> The edict of Milan secured the revenue as well as the peace of the church </s>
<s> 101 The Christians not only recovered the lands and houses of which they had been stripped by the persecuting laws of Diocletian but they acquired a perfect title to all the possessions which they had hitherto enjoyed by the connivance of the magistrate </s>
<s> As soon as Christianity became the religion of the emperor and the empire the national clergy might claim a decent and honorable maintenance and the payment of an annual tax might have delivered the people from the more oppressive tribute which superstition imposes on her votaries </s>
<s> But as the wants and expenses of the church increased with her prosperity the ecclesiastical order was still supported and enriched by the voluntary oblations of the faithful </s>
<s> Eight years after the edict of Milan Constantine granted to all his subjects the free and universal permission of bequeathing their fortunes to the holy Catholic church 102 and their devout liberality which during their lives was checked by luxury or avarice flowed with a profuse stream at the hour of their death </s>
<s> The wealthy Christians were encouraged by the example of their sovereign </s>
<s> An absolute monarch who is rich without patrimony may be charitable without merit and Constantine too easily believed that he should purchase the favor of Heaven if he maintained the idle at the expense of the industrious and distributed among the saints the wealth of the republic </s>
<s> The same messenger who carried over to Africa the head of Maxentius might be intrusted with an epistle to Caecilian bishop of Carthage </s>
<s> The emperor acquaints him that the treasurers of the province are directed to pay into his hands the sum of three thousand folles or eighteen thousand pounds sterling and to obey his further requisitions for the relief of the churches of Africa Numidia and Mauritania </s>
<s> 103 The liberality of Constantine increased in a just proportion to his faith and to his vices </s>
<s> He assigned in each city a regular allowance of corn to supply the fund of ecclesiastical charity and the persons of both sexes who embraced the monastic life became the peculiar favorites of their sovereign </s>

<s> The timbers were framed for the most part of cedars of Libanus the roof was covered with tiles perhaps of gilt brass and the walls the columns the pavement were encrusted with variegated marbles </s>
<s> The most precious ornaments of gold and silver of silk and gems were profusely dedicated to the service of the altar and this specious magnificence was supported on the solid and perpetual basis of landed property </s>
<s> In the space of two centuries from the reign of Constantine to that of Justinian the eighteen hundred churches of the empire were enriched by the frequent and unalienable gifts of the prince and people </s>
<s> An annual income of six hundred pounds sterling may be reasonably assigned to the bishops who were placed at an equal distance between riches and poverty 105 but the standard of their wealth insensibly rose with the dignity and opulence of the cities which they governed </s>

<s> The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest </s>
<s> Constantine gave them security wealth honors and revenge and the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate </s>
<s> The edict of Milan the great charter of toleration had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and professing his own religion </s>
<s> But this inestimable privilege was soon violated with the knowledge of truth the emperor imbibed the maxims of persecution and the sects which dissented from the Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of Christianity </s>
<s> Constantine easily believed that the Heretics who presumed to dispute his opinions or to oppose his commands were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy and that a seasonable application of moderate severities might save those unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation </s>
<s> Not a moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the separated congregations from any share of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the orthodox clergy </s>
<s> But as the sectaries might still exist under the cloud of royal disgrace the conquest of the East was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total destruction </s>
<s> 1 After a preamble filled with passion and reproach Constantine absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics and confiscates their public property to the use either of the revenue or of the Catholic church </s>
<s> The sects against whom the Imperial severity was directed appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samosata the Montanists of Phrygia who maintained an enthusiastic succession of prophecy the Novatians who sternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance the Marcionites and Valentinians under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied and perhaps the Manichaeans who had recently imported from Persia a more artful composition of Oriental and Christian theology </s>
<s> 2 The design of extirpating the name or at least of restraining the progress of these odious Heretics was prosecuted with vigor and effect </s>
<s> Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocletian and this method of conversion was applauded by the same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression and pleaded for the rights of humanity </s>
<s> Two immaterial circumstances may serve however to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry </s>

<s> The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually confined by creeds and confessions 40 the freedom of private judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods the authority of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank and the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief </s>

<s> 47 I </s>
<s> According to the first hypothesis which was maintained by Arius and his disciples the Logos was a dependent and spontaneous production created from nothing by the will of the father </s>
<s> The Son by whom all things were made 48 had been begotten before all worlds and the longest of the astronomical periods could be compared only as a fleeting moment to the extent of his duration yet this duration was not infinite 49 and there had been a time which preceded the ineffable generation of the Logos </s>
<s> On this onlybegotten Son the Almighty Father had transfused his ample spirit and impressed the effulgence of his glory </s>
<s> Visible image of invisible perfection he saw at an immeasurable distance beneath his feet the thrones of the brightest archangels yet he shone only with a reflected light and like the sons of the Romans emperors who were invested with the titles of Caesar or Augustus 50 he governed the universe in obedience to the will of his Father and Monarch </s>
<s> II </s>
<s> In the second hypothesis the Logos possessed all the inherent incommunicable perfections which religion and philosophy appropriate to the Supreme God </s>
<s> Three distinct and infinite minds or substances three coequal and coeternal beings composed the Divine Essence 51 and it would have implied contradiction that any of them should not have existed or that they should ever cease to exist </s>
<s> 52 The advocates of a system which seemed to establish three independent Deities attempted to preserve the unity of the First Cause so conspicuous in the design and order of the world by the perpetual concord of their administration and the essential agreement of their will </s>
<s> A faint resemblance of this unity of action may be discovered in the societies of men and even of animals </s>
<s> The causes which disturb their harmony proceed only from the imperfection and inequality of their faculties but the omnipotence which is guided by infinite wisdom and goodness cannot fail of choosing the same means for the accomplishment of the same ends </s>
<s> III </s>
<s> Three beings who by the selfderived necessity of their existence possess all the divine attributes in the most perfect degree who are eternal in duration infinite in space and intimately present to each other and to the whole universe irresistibly force themselves on the astonished mind as one and the same being 53 who in the economy of grace as well as in that of nature may manifest himself under different forms and be considered under different aspects </s>
<s> By this hypothesis a real substantial trinity is refined into a trinity of names and abstract modifications that subsist only in the mind which conceives them </s>
<s> The Logos is no longer a person but an attribute and it is only in a figurative sense that the epithet of Son can be applied to the eternal reason which was with God from the beginning and by which not by whom all things were made </s>
<s> The incarnation of the Logos is reduced to a mere inspiration of the Divine Wisdom which filled the soul and directed all the actions of the man Jesus </s>
<s> Thus after revolving around the theological circle we are surprised to find that the Sabellian ends where the Ebionite had begun and that the incomprehensible mystery which excites our adoration eludes our inquiry </s>

<s> The Arians soon perceived the danger of their situation and prudently assumed those modest virtues which in the fury of civil and religious dissensions are seldom practised or even praised except by the weaker party </s>
<s> They recommended the exercise of Christian charity and moderation urged the incomprehensible nature of the controversy disclaimed the use of any terms or definitions which could not be found in the Scriptures and offered by very liberal concessions to satisfy their adversaries without renouncing the integrity of their own principles </s>
<s> The victorious faction received all their proposals with haughty suspicion and anxiously sought for some irreconcilable mark of distinction the rejection of which might involve the Arians in the guilt and consequences of heresy </s>
<s> A letter was publicly read and ignominiously torn in which their patron Eusebius of Nicomedia ingenuously confessed that the admission of the Homoousion or Consubstantial a word already familiar to the Platonists was incompatible with the principles of their theological system </s>
<s> The fortunate opportunity was eagerly embraced by the bishops who governed the resolutions of the synod and according to the lively expression of Ambrose 56 they used the sword which heresy itself had drawn from the scabbard to cut off the head of the hated monster </s>
<s> The consubstantiality of the Father and the Son was established by the council of Nice and has been unanimously received as a fundamental article of the Christian faith by the consent of the Greek the Latin the Oriental and the Protestant churches </s>
<s> But if the same word had not served to stigmatize the heretics and to unite the Catholics it would have been inadequate to the purpose of the majority by whom it was introduced into the orthodox creed </s>
<s> This majority was divided into two parties distinguished by a contrary tendency to the sentiments of the Tritheists and of the Sabellians </s>
<s> But as those opposite extremes seemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural or revealed religion they mutually agreed to qualify the rigor of their principles and to disavow the just but invidious consequences which might be urged by their antagonists </s>
<s> The interest of the common cause inclined them to join their numbers and to conceal their differences their animosity was softened by the healing counsels of toleration and their disputes were suspended by the use of the mysterious Homoousion which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets </s>
<s> The Sabellian sense which about fifty years before had obliged the council of Antioch 57 to prohibit this celebrated term had endeared it to those theologians who entertained a secret but partial affection for a nominal Trinity </s>
<s> But the more fashionable saints of the Arian times the intrepid Athanasius the learned Gregory Nazianzen and the other pillars of the church who supported with ability and success the Nicene doctrine appeared to consider the expression of substance as if it had been synonymous with that of nature and they ventured to illustrate their meaning by affirming that three men as they belong to the same common species are consubstantial or homoousian to each other </s>
<s> 58 This pure and distinct equality was tempered on the one hand by the internal connection and spiritual penetration which indissolubly unites the divine persons 59 and on the other by the preeminence of the Father which was acknowledged as far as it is compatible with the independence of the Son </s>
<s> 60 Within these limits the almost invisible and tremulous ball of orthodoxy was allowed securely to vibrate </s>
<s> On either side beyond this consecrated ground the heretics and the daemons lurked in ambush to surprise and devour the unhappy wanderer </s>
<s> But as the degrees of theological hatred depend on the spirit of the war rather than on the importance of the controversy the heretics who degraded were treated with more severity than those who annihilated the person of the Son </s>
<s> The life of Athanasius was consumed in irreconcilable opposition to the impious madness of the Arians 61 but he defended above twenty years the Sabellianism of Marcellus of Ancyra and when at last he was compelled to withdraw himself from his communion he continued to mention with an ambiguous smile the venial errors of his respectable friend </s>

<s> It is amusing enough to delineate the form and to trace the vegetation of a singular plant but the tedious detail of leaves without flowers and of branches without fruit would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student </s>
<s> One question which gradually arose from the Arian controversy may however be noticed as it served to produce and discriminate the three sects who were united only by their common aversion to the Homoousion of the Nicene synod </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> If they were asked whether the Son was like unto the Father the question was resolutely answered in the negative by the heretics who adhered to the principles of Arius or indeed to those of philosophy which seem to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the most excellent of his creatures </s>
<s> This obvious consequence was maintained by Aetius 67 on whom the zeal of his adversaries bestowed the surname of the Atheist </s>
<s> His restless and aspiring spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life </s>
<s> He was successively a slave or at least a husbandman a travelling tinker a goldsmith a physician a schoolmaster a theologian and at last the apostle of a new church which was propagated by the abilities of his disciple Eunomius </s>
<s> 68 Armed with texts of Scripture and with captious syllogisms from the logic of Aristotle the subtle Aetius had acquired the fame of an invincible disputant whom it was impossible either to silence or to convince </s>
<s> Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian bishops till they were forced to renounce and even to persecute a dangerous ally who by the accuracy of his reasoning had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion and offended the piety of their most devoted followers </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> The omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful solution of the likeness of the Father and the Son and faith might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections and create a being similar only to himself </s>
<s> 69 These Arians were powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their leaders who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian interest and who occupied the principal thrones of the East </s>
<s> They detested perhaps with some affectation the impiety of Aetius they professed to believe either without reserve or according to the Scriptures that the Son was different from all other creatures and similar only to the Father </s>
<s> But they denied the he was either of the same or of a similar substance sometimes boldly justifying their dissent and sometimes objecting to the use of the word substance which seems to imply an adequate or at least a distinct notion of the nature of the Deity </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> The sect which deserted the doctrine of a similar substance was the most numerous at least in the provinces of Asia and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the council of Seleucia 70 their opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to fortythree bishops </s>
<s> The Greek word which was chosen to express this mysterious resemblance bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol that the profane of every age have derided the furious contests which the difference of a single diphthong excited between the Homoousians and the Homoiousians </s>
<s> As it frequently happens that the sounds and characters which approach the nearest to each other accidentally represent the most opposite ideas the observation would be itself ridiculous if it were possible to mark any real and sensible distinction between the doctrine of the SemiArians as they were improperly styled and that of the Catholics themselves </s>
<s> The bishop of Poitiers who in his Phrygian exile very wisely aimed at a coalition of parties endeavors to prove that by a pious and faithful interpretation 71 the Homoiousion may be reduced to a consubstantial sense </s>

<s> The familiar study of the Platonic system a vain and argumentative disposition a copious and flexible idiom supplied the clergy and people of the East with an inexhaustible flow of words and distinctions and in the midst of their fierce contentions they easily forgot the doubt which is recommended by philosophy and the submission which is enjoined by religion </s>
<s> The inhabitants of the West were of a less inquisitive spirit their passions were not so forcibly moved by invisible objects their minds were less frequently exercised by the habits of dispute and such was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church that Hilary himself above thirty years after the first general council was still a stranger to the Nicene creed </s>

<s> 74 But as the western provincials had the good fortune of deriving their religion from an orthodox source they preserved with steadiness the doctrine which they had accepted with docility and when the Arian pestilence approached their frontiers they were supplied with the seasonable preservative of the Homoousion by the paternal care of the Roman pontiff </s>
<s> Their sentiments and their temper were displayed in the memorable synod of Rimini which surpassed in numbers the council of Nice since it was composed of above four hundred bishops of Italy Africa Spain Gaul Britain and Illyricum </s>
<s> From the first debates it appeared that only fourscore prelates adhered to the party though they affected to anathematize the name and memory of Arius </s>
<s> But this inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill of experience and of discipline and the minority was conducted by Valens and Ursacius two bishops of Illyricum who had spent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils and who had been trained under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of the East </s>
<s> By their arguments and negotiations they embarrassed they confounded they at last deceived the honest simplicity of the Latin bishops who suffered the palladium of the faith to be extorted from their hand by fraud and importunity rather than by open violence </s>
<s> The council of Rimini was not allowed to separate till the members had imprudently subscribed a captious creed in which some expressions susceptible of an heretical sense were inserted in the room of the Homoousion </s>
<s> It was on this occasion that according to Jerom the world was surprised to find itself Arian </s>
<s> 75 But the bishops of the Latin provinces had no sooner reached their respective dioceses than they discovered their mistake and repented of their weakness </s>

<s> Such was the rise and progress and such were the natural revolutions of those theological disputes which disturbed the peace of Christianity under the reigns of Constantine and of his sons </s>
<s> But as those princes presumed to extend their despotism over the faith as well as over the lives and fortunes of their subjects the weight of their suffrage sometimes inclined the ecclesiastical balance and the prerogatives of the King of Heaven were settled or changed or modified in the cabinet of an earthly monarch </s>
<s> The unhappy spirit of discord which pervaded the provinces of the East interrupted the triumph of Constantine but the emperor continued for some time to view with cool and careless indifference the object of the dispute </s>
<s> As he was yet ignorant of the difficulty of appeasing the quarrels of theologians he addressed to the contending parties to Alexander and to Arius a moderating epistle 77 which may be ascribed with far greater reason to the untutored sense of a soldier and statesman than to the dictates of any of his episcopal counsellors </s>
<s> He attributes the origin of the whole controversy to a trifling and subtle question concerning an incomprehensible point of law which was foolishly asked by the bishop and imprudently resolved by the presbyter </s>
<s> He laments that the Christian people who had the same God the same religion and the same worship should be divided by such inconsiderable distinctions and he seriously recommend to the clergy of Alexandria the example of the Greek philosophers who could maintain their arguments without losing their temper and assert their freedom without violating their friendship </s>
<s> The indifference and contempt of the sovereign would have been perhaps the most effectual method of silencing the dispute if the popular current had been less rapid and impetuous and if Constantine himself in the midst of faction and fanaticism could have preserved the calm possession of his own mind </s>
<s> But his ecclesiastical ministers soon contrived to seduce the impartiality of the magistrate and to awaken the zeal of the proselyte </s>
<s> He was provoked by the insults which had been offered to his statues he was alarmed by the real as well as the imaginary magnitude of the spreading mischief and he extinguished the hope of peace and toleration from the moment that he assembled three hundred bishops within the walls of the same palace </s>
<s> The presence of the monarch swelled the importance of the debate his attention multiplied the arguments and he exposed his person with a patient intrepidity which animated the valor of the combatants </s>
<s> Notwithstanding the applause which has been bestowed on the eloquence and sagacity of Constantine 78 a Roman general whose religion might be still a subject of doubt and whose mind had not been enlightened either by study or by inspiration was indifferently qualified to discuss in the Greek language a metaphysical question or an article of faith </s>
<s> But the credit of his favorite Osius who appears to have presided in the council of Nice might dispose the emperor in favor of the orthodox party and a welltimed insinuation that the same Eusebius of Nicomedia who now protected the heretic had lately assisted the tyrant 79 might exasperate him against their adversaries </s>
<s> The Nicene creed was ratified by Constantine and his firm declaration that those who resisted the divine judgment of the synod must prepare themselves for an immediate exile annihilated the murmurs of a feeble opposition which from seventeen was almost instantly reduced to two protesting bishops </s>
<s> Eusebius of Caesarea yielded a reluctant and ambiguous consent to the Homoousion 80 and the wavering conduct of the Nicomedian Eusebius served only to delay about three months his disgrace and exile </s>

<s> It is singular enough that the important task of continuing the history of the church should have been left for two laymen and a heretic.] The sons of Constantine must have been admitted from their childhood into the rank of catechumens but they imitated in the delay of their baptism the example of their father </s>
<s> Like him they presumed to pronounce their judgment on mysteries into which they had never been regularly initiated 85 and the fate of the Trinitarian controversy depended in a great measure on the sentiments of Constantius who inherited the provinces of the East and acquired the possession of the whole empire </s>

<s> 92 As soon as the emperor was relieved from the terrors of the civil war he devoted the leisure of his winter quarters at Arles Milan Sirmium and Constantinople to the amusement or toils of controversy the sword of the magistrate and even of the tyrant was unsheathed to enforce the reasons of the theologian and as he opposed the orthodox faith of Nice it is readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to his presumption </s>

<s> His learning was much less profound and extensive than that of Eusebius of Caesarea and his rude eloquence could not be compared with the polished oratory of Gregory of Basil but whenever the primate of Egypt was called upon to justify his sentiments or his conduct his unpremeditated style either of speaking or writing was clear forcible and persuasive </s>

<s> The synod of Tyre was conducted by Eusebius of Caesarea with more passion and with less art than his learning and experience might promise his numerous faction repeated the names of homicide and tyrant and their clamors were encouraged by the seeming patience of Athanasius who expected the decisive moment to produce Arsenius alive and unhurt in the midst of the assembly </s>

<s> The Arians who had secretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy attempted however to disguise their injustice by the imitation of judicial forms the synod appointed an episcopal commission of six delegates to collect evidence on the spot and this measure which was vigorously opposed by the Egyptian bishops opened new scenes of violence and perjury </s>

<s> On the memorable night when the church of St. Theonas was invested by the troops of Syrianus the archbishop seated on his throne expected with calm and intrepid dignity the approach of death </s>
<s> While the public devotion was interrupted by shouts of rage and cries of terror he animated his trembling congregation to express their religious confidence by chanting one of the psalms of David which celebrates the triumph of the God of Israel over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt </s>
<s> The doors were at length burst open a cloud of arrows was discharged among the people the soldiers with drawn swords rushed forwards into the sanctuary and the dreadful gleam of their arms was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar </s>
<s> 136 Athanasius still rejected the pious importunity of the monks and presbyters who were attached to his person and nobly refused to desert his episcopal station till he had dismissed in safety the last of the congregation </s>
<s> The darkness and tumult of the night favored the retreat of the archbishop and though he was oppressed by the waves of an agitated multitude though he was thrown to the ground and left without sense or motion he still recovered his undaunted courage and eluded the eager search of the soldiers who were instructed by their Arian guides that the head of Athanasius would be the most acceptable present to the emperor </s>
<s> From that moment the primate of Egypt disappeared from the eyes of his enemies and remained above six years concealed in impenetrable obscurity </s>

<s> 138 But the deserts of Thebais were now peopled by a race of wild yet submissive fanatics who preferred the commands of their abbot to the laws of their sovereign </s>
<s> The numerous disciples of Antony and Pachonnus received the fugitive primate as their father admired the patience and humility with which he conformed to their strictest institutions collected every word which dropped from his lips as the genuine effusions of inspired wisdom and persuaded themselves that their prayers their fasts and their vigils were less meritorious than the zeal which they expressed and the dangers which they braved in the defence of truth and innocence </s>
<s> 139 The monasteries of Egypt were seated in lonely and desolate places on the summit of mountains or in the islands of the Nile and the sacred horn or trumpet of Tabenne was the wellknown signal which assembled several thousand robust and determined monks who for the most part had been the peasants of the adjacent country </s>
<s> When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force which it was impossible to resist they silently stretched out their necks to the executioner and supported their national character that tortures could never wrest from an Egyptian the confession of a secret which he was resolved not to disclose </s>

<s> The retirement of Athanasius which ended only with the life of Constantius was spent for the most part in the society of the monks who faithfully served him as guards as secretaries and as messengers but the importance of maintaining a more intimate connection with the Catholic party tempted him whenever the diligence of the pursuit was abated to emerge from the desert to introduce himself into Alexandria and to trust his person to the discretion of his friends and adherents </s>

<s> Without imparting the secret to any one she instantly conducted Athanasius into her most secret chamber and watched over his safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a servant </s>
<s> As long as the danger continued she regularly supplied him with books and provisions washed his feet managed his correspondence and dexterously concealed from the eye of suspicion this familiar and solitary intercourse between a saint whose character required the most unblemished chastity and a female whose charms might excite the most dangerous emotions </s>
<s> 142 During the six years of persecution and exile Athanasius repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion and the formal declaration that he saw the councils of Rimini and Seleucia 143 forces us to believe that he was secretly present at the time and place of their convocation </s>
<s> The advantage of personally negotiating with his friends and of observing and improving the divisions of his enemies might justify in a prudent statesman so bold and dangerous an enterprise and Alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every seaport of the Mediterranean </s>
<s> From the depth of his inaccessible retreat the intrepid primate waged an incessant and offensive war against the protector of the Arians and his seasonable writings which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused contributed to unite and animate the orthodox party </s>
<s> In his public apologies which he addressed to the emperor himself he sometimes affected the praise of moderation whilst at the same time in secret and vehement invectives he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked prince the executioner of his family the tyrant of the republic and the Antichrist of the church </s>
<s> In the height of his prosperity the victorious monarch who had chastised the rashness of Gallus and suppressed the revolt of Sylvanus who had taken the diadem from the head of Vetranio and vanquished in the field the legions of Magnentius received from an invisible hand a wound which he could neither heal nor revenge and the son of Constantine was the first of the Christian princes who experienced the strength of those principles which in the cause of religion could resist the most violent exertions 144 of the civil power </s>

<s> The zeal of the philosophic historian for the rights of mankind has induced him to acquiesce in the ambiguous testimony of those ecclesiastics who have too lightly ascribed to their favorite hero the merit of a general persecution </s>
<s> 164 Instead of alleging this imaginary law which would have blazed in the front of the Imperial codes we may safely appeal to the original epistle which Constantine addressed to the followers of the ancient religion at a time when he no longer disguised his conversion nor dreaded the rivals of his throne </s>

<s> They easily discovered that his simplicity was not exempt from affectation the ridiculous epithets of a hairy savage of an ape invested with the purple were applied to the dress and person of the philosophic warrior and his modest despatches were stigmatized as the vain and elaborate fictions of a loquacious Greek a speculative soldier who had studied the art of war amidst the groves of the academy </s>

<s> 4 The Caesar foresaw and lamented the consequences of this fatal mandate </s>
<s> Most of the auxiliaries who engaged their voluntary service had stipulated that they should never be obliged to pass the Alps </s>

<s> The inexorable jealousy of the emperor the peremptory and perhaps insidious nature of his commands left not any room for a fair apology or candid interpretation and the dependent station of the Caesar scarcely allowed him to pause or to deliberate </s>
<s> Solitude increased the perplexity of Julian he could no longer apply to the faithful counsels of Sallust who had been removed from his office by the judicious malice of the eunuchs he could not even enforce his representations by the concurrence of the ministers who would have been afraid or ashamed to approve the ruin of Gaul </s>

<s> Two days were devoted to the public joy which was celebrated by the games of the circus but early on the morning of the third day Julian marched to occupy the narrow pass of Succi in the defiles of Mount Haemus which almost in the midway between Sirmium and Constantinople separates the provinces of Thrace and Dacia by an abrupt descent towards the former and a gentle declivity on the side of the latter </s>

<s> Part III </s>
<s> Philosophy had instructed Julian to compare the advantages of action and retirement but the elevation of his birth and the accidents of his life never allowed him the freedom of choice </s>
<s> He might perhaps sincerely have preferred the groves of the academy and the society of Athens but he was constrained at first by the will and afterwards by the injustice of Constantius to expose his person and fame to the dangers of Imperial greatness and to make himself accountable to the world and to posterity for the happiness of millions </s>
<s> 46 Julian recollected with terror the observation of his master Plato 47 that the government of our flocks and herds is always committed to beings of a superior species and that the conduct of nations requires and deserves the celestial powers of the gods or of the genii </s>
<s> From this principle he justly concluded that the man who presumes to reign should aspire to the perfection of the divine nature that he should purify his soul from her mortal and terrestrial part that he should extinguish his appetites enlighten his understanding regulate his passions and subdue the wild beast which according to the lively metaphor of Aristotle 48 seldom fails to ascend the throne of a despot </s>
<s> The throne of Julian which the death of Constantius fixed on an independent basis was the seat of reason of virtue and perhaps of vanity </s>
<s> He despised the honors renounced the pleasures and discharged with incessant diligence the duties of his exalted station and there were few among his subjects who would have consented to relieve him from the weight of the diadem had they been obliged to submit their time and their actions to the rigorous laws which that philosophic emperor imposed on himself </s>
<s> One of his most intimate friends 49 who had often shared the frugal simplicity of his table has remarked that his light and sparing diet which was usually of the vegetable kind left his mind and body always free and active for the various and important business of an author a pontiff a magistrate a general and a prince </s>
<s> In one and the same day he gave audience to several ambassadors and wrote or dictated a great number of letters to his generals his civil magistrates his private friends and the different cities of his dominions </s>
<s> He listened to the memorials which had been received considered the subject of the petitions and signified his intentions more rapidly than they could be taken in shorthand by the diligence of his secretaries </s>
<s> He possessed such flexibility of thought and such firmness of attention that he could employ his hand to write his ear to listen and his voice to dictate and pursue at once three several trains of ideas without hesitation and without error </s>
<s> While his ministers reposed the prince flew with agility from one labor to another and after a hasty dinner retired into his library till the public business which he had appointed for the evening summoned him to interrupt the prosecution of his studies </s>
<s> The supper of the emperor was still less substantial than the former meal his sleep was never clouded by the fumes of indigestion and except in the short interval of a marriage which was the effect of policy rather than love the chaste Julian never shared his bed with a female companion </s>
<s> 50 He was soon awakened by the entrance of fresh secretaries who had slept the preceding day and his servants were obliged to wait alternately while their indefatigable master allowed himself scarcely any other refreshment than the change of occupation </s>
<s> The predecessors of Julian his uncle his brother and his cousin indulged their puerile taste for the games of the Circus under the specious pretence of complying with the inclinations of the people and they frequently remained the greatest part of the day as idle spectators and as a part of the splendid spectacle till the ordinary round of twentyfour races 51 was completely finished </s>
<s> On solemn festivals Julian who felt and professed an unfashionable dislike to these frivolous amusements condescended to appear in the Circus and after bestowing a careless glance at five or six of the races he hastily withdrew with the impatience of a philosopher who considered every moment as lost that was not devoted to the advantage of the public or the improvement of his own mind </s>

<s> A thousand barbers a thousand cupbearers a thousand cooks were distributed in the several offices of luxury and the number of eunuchs could be compared only with the insects of a summer's day </s>

<s> The most exquisite dainties were procured to gratify their pride rather than their taste birds of the most distant climates fish from the most remote seas fruits out of their natural season winter roses and summer snows </s>
<s> 56 The domestic crowd of the palace surpassed the expense of the legions yet the smallest part of this costly multitude was subservient to the use or even to the splendor of the throne </s>
<s> The monarch was disgraced and the people was injured by the creation and sale of an infinite number of obscure and even titular employments and the most worthless of mankind might purchase the privilege of being maintained without the necessity of labor from the public revenue </s>
<s> The waste of an enormous household the increase of fees and perquisites which were soon claimed as a lawful debt and the bribes which they extorted from those who feared their enmity or solicited their favor suddenly enriched these haughty menials </s>
<s> They abused their fortune without considering their past or their future condition and their rapine and venality could be equalled only by the extravagance of their dissipations </s>
<s> Their silken robes were embroidered with gold their tables were served with delicacy and profusion the houses which they built for their own use would have covered the farm of an ancient consul and the most honorable citizens were obliged to dismount from their horses and respectfully to salute a eunuch whom they met on the public highway </s>

<s> To conduct this inquiry Julian named six judges of the highest rank in the state and army and as he wished to escape the reproach of condemning his personal enemies he fixed this extraordinary tribunal at Chalcedon on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus and transferred to the commissioners an absolute power to pronounce and execute their final sentence without delay and without appeal </s>

<s> Part IV </s>
<s> The numerous army of spies of agents and informers enlisted by Constantius to secure the repose of one man and to interrupt that of millions was immediately disbanded by his generous successor </s>
<s> Julian was slow in his suspicions and gentle in his punishments and his contempt of treason was the result of judgment of vanity and of courage </s>
<s> Conscious of superior merit he was persuaded that few among his subjects would dare to meet him in the field to attempt his life or even to seat themselves on his vacant throne </s>
<s> The philosopher could excuse the hasty sallies of discontent and the hero could despise the ambitious projects which surpassed the fortune or the abilities of the rash conspirators </s>
<s> A citizen of Ancyra had prepared for his own use a purple garment and this indiscreet action which under the reign of Constantius would have been considered as a capital offence 68 was reported to Julian by the officious importunity of a private enemy </s>
<s> The monarch after making some inquiry into the rank and character of his rival despatched the informer with a present of a pair of purple slippers to complete the magnificence of his Imperial habit </s>
<s> A more dangerous conspiracy was formed by ten of the domestic guards who had resolved to assassinate Julian in the field of exercise near Antioch </s>
<s> Their intemperance revealed their guilt and they were conducted in chains to the presence of their injured sovereign who after a lively representation of the wickedness and folly of their enterprise instead of a death of torture which they deserved and expected pronounced a sentence of exile against the two principal offenders </s>
<s> The only instance in which Julian seemed to depart from his accustomed clemency was the execution of a rash youth who with a feeble hand had aspired to seize the reins of empire </s>
<s> But that youth was the son of Marcellus the general of cavalry who in the first campaign of the Gallic war had deserted the standard of the Caesar and the republic </s>
<s> Without appearing to indulge his personal resentment Julian might easily confound the crime of the son and of the father but he was reconciled by the distress of Marcellus and the liberality of the emperor endeavored to heal the wound which had been inflicted by the hand of justice </s>

<s> 323.] Julian was not insensible of the advantages of freedom </s>
<s> 70 From his studies he had imbibed the spirit of ancient sages and heroes his life and fortunes had depended on the caprice of a tyrant and when he ascended the throne his pride was sometimes mortified by the reflection that the slaves who would not dare to censure his defects were not worthy to applaud his virtues </s>
<s> 71 He sincerely abhorred the system of Oriental despotism which Diocletian Constantine and the patient habits of fourscore years had established in the empire </s>
<s> A motive of superstition prevented the execution of the design which Julian had frequently meditated of relieving his head from the weight of a costly diadem 72 but he absolutely refused the title of Dominus or Lord 73 a word which was grown so familiar to the ears of the Romans that they no longer remembered its servile and humiliating origin </s>
<s> The office or rather the name of consul was cherished by a prince who contemplated with reverence the ruins of the republic and the same behavior which had been assumed by the prudence of Augustus was adopted by Julian from choice and inclination </s>
<s> On the calends of January at break of day the new consuls Mamertinus and Nevitta hastened to the palace to salute the emperor </s>
<s> As soon as he was informed of their approach he leaped from his throne eagerly advanced to meet them and compelled the blushing magistrates to receive the demonstrations of his affected humility </s>
<s> From the palace they proceeded to the senate </s>
<s> The emperor on foot marched before their litters and the gazing multitude admired the image of ancient times or secretly blamed a conduct which in their eyes degraded the majesty of the purple </s>
<s> 74 But the behavior of Julian was uniformly supported </s>
<s> During the games of the Circus he had imprudently or designedly performed the manumission of a slave in the presence of the consul </s>
<s> The moment he was reminded that he had trespassed on the jurisdiction of another magistrate he condemned himself to pay a fine of ten pounds of gold and embraced this public occasion of declaring to the world that he was subject like the rest of his fellowcitizens to the laws 75 and even to the forms of the republic </s>
<s> The spirit of his administration and his regard for the place of his nativity induced Julian to confer on the senate of Constantinople the same honors privileges and authority which were still enjoyed by the senate of ancient Rome </s>
<s> 76 A legal fiction was introduced and gradually established that one half of the national council had migrated into the East and the despotic successors of Julian accepting the title of Senators acknowledged themselves the members of a respectable body which was permitted to represent the majesty of the Roman name </s>
<s> From Constantinople the attention of the monarch was extended to the municipal senates of the provinces </s>
<s> He abolished by repeated edicts the unjust and pernicious exemptions which had withdrawn so many idle citizens from the services of their country and by imposing an equal distribution of public duties he restored the strength the splendor or according to the glowing expression of Libanius 77 the soul of the expiring cities of his empire </s>
<s> The venerable age of Greece excited the most tender compassion in the mind of Julian which kindled into rapture when he recollected the gods the heroes and the men superior to heroes and to gods who have bequeathed to the latest posterity the monuments of their genius or the example of their virtues </s>
<s> He relieved the distress and restored the beauty of the cities of Epirus and Peloponnesus </s>
<s> 78 Athens acknowledged him for her benefactor Argos for her deliverer </s>
<s> The pride of Corinth again rising from her ruins with the honors of a Roman colony exacted a tribute from the adjacent republics for the purpose of defraying the games of the Isthmus which were celebrated in the amphitheatre with the hunting of bears and panthers </s>
<s> From this tribute the cities of Elis of Delphi and of Argos which had inherited from their remote ancestors the sacred office of perpetuating the Olympic the Pythian and the Nemean games claimed a just exemption </s>
<s> The immunity of Elis and Delphi was respected by the Corinthians but the poverty of Argos tempted the insolence of oppression and the feeble complaints of its deputies were silenced by the decree of a provincial magistrate who seems to have consulted only the interest of the capital in which he resided </s>

<s> The assemblies of the senate which Constantius had avoided were considered by Julian as the place where he could exhibit with the most propriety the maxims of a republican and the talents of a rhetorician </s>
<s> He alternately practised as in a school of declamation the several modes of praise of censure of exhortation and his friend Libanius has remarked that the study of Homer taught him to imitate the simple concise style of Menelaus the copiousness of Nestor whose words descended like the flakes of a winter's snow or the pathetic and forcible eloquence of Ulysses </s>
<s> The functions of a judge which are sometimes incompatible with those of a prince were exercised by Julian not only as a duty but as an amusement and although he might have trusted the integrity and discernment of his Praetorian praefects he often placed himself by their side on the seat of judgment </s>

<s> Their speculative opinions were imposed as positive laws and guarded by the terrors of eternal punishments but while they prescribed the rigid formulary of the thoughts the words and the actions of the young prince whilst they silenced his objections and severely checked the freedom of his inquiries they secretly provoked his impatient genius to disclaim the authority of his ecclesiastical guides </s>

<s> 194.] But the devout philosopher who sincerely embraced and warmly encouraged the superstition of the people reserved for himself the privilege of a liberal interpretation and silently withdrew from the foot of the altars into the sanctuary of the temple </s>
<s> The extravagance of the Grecian mythology proclaimed with a clear and audible voice that the pious inquirer instead of being scandalized or satisfied with the literal sense should diligently explore the occult wisdom which had been disguised by the prudence of antiquity under the mask of folly and of fable </s>
<s> 15 The philosophers of the Platonic school 16 Plotinus Porphyry and the divine Iamblichus were admired as the most skilful masters of this allegorical science which labored to soften and harmonize the deformed features of Paganism </s>
<s> Julian himself who was directed in the mysterious pursuit by Aedesius the venerable successor of Iamblichus aspired to the possession of a treasure which he esteemed if we may credit his solemn asseverations far above the empire of the world </s>
<s> 17 It was indeed a treasure which derived its value only from opinion and every artist who flattered himself that he had extracted the precious ore from the surrounding dross claimed an equal right of stamping the name and figure the most agreeable to his peculiar fancy </s>
<s> The fable of Atys and Cybele had been already explained by Porphyry but his labors served only to animate the pious industry of Julian who invented and published his own allegory of that ancient and mystic tale </s>
<s> This freedom of interpretation which might gratify the pride of the Platonists exposed the vanity of their art </s>
<s> Without a tedious detail the modern reader could not form a just idea of the strange allusions the forced etymologies the solemn trifling and the impenetrable obscurity of these sages who professed to reveal the system of the universe </s>
<s> As the traditions of Pagan mythology were variously related the sacred interpreters were at liberty to select the most convenient circumstances and as they translated an arbitrary cipher they could extract from any fable any sense which was adapted to their favorite system of religion and philosophy </s>

<s> The transition of Atys from the wildest enthusiasm to sober pathetic complaint for his irretrievable loss must inspire a man with pity a eunuch with despair.] The theological system of Julian appears to have contained the sublime and important principles of natural religion </s>
<s> But as the faith which is not founded on revelation must remain destitute of any firm assurance the disciple of Plato imprudently relapsed into the habits of vulgar superstition and the popular and philosophic notion of the Deity seems to have been confounded in the practice the writings and even in the mind of Julian </s>
<s> 19 The pious emperor acknowledged and adored the Eternal Cause of the universe to whom he ascribed all the perfections of an infinite nature invisible to the eyes and inaccessible to the understanding of feeble mortals </s>
<s> The Supreme God had created or rather in the Platonic language had generated the gradual succession of dependent spirits of gods of daemons of heroes and of men and every being which derived its existence immediately from the First Cause received the inherent gift of immortality </s>
<s> That so precious an advantage might be lavished upon unworthy objects the Creator had intrusted to the skill and power of the inferior gods the office of forming the human body and of arranging the beautiful harmony of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms </s>

<s> If in the time of Julian these arts had been practised only by the pagan priests for the support of an expiring cause some indulgence might perhaps be allowed to the interest and habits of the sacerdotal character </s>
<s> But it may appear a subject of surprise and scandal that the philosophers themselves should have contributed to abuse the superstitious credulity of mankind 22 and that the Grecian mysteries should have been supported by the magic or theurgy of the modern Platonists </s>
<s> They arrogantly pretended to control the order of nature to explore the secrets of futurity to command the service of the inferior daemons to enjoy the view and conversation of the superior gods and by disengaging the soul from her material bands to reunite that immortal particle with the Infinite and Divine Spirit </s>

<s> 23 Julian imbibed the first rudiments of the Platonic doctrines from the mouth of Aedesius who had fixed at Pergamus his wandering and persecuted school </s>
<s> But as the declining strength of that venerable sage was unequal to the ardor the diligence the rapid conception of his pupil two of his most learned disciples Chrysanthes and Eusebius supplied at his own desire the place of their aged master </s>
<s> These philosophers seem to have prepared and distributed their respective parts and they artfully contrived by dark hints and affected disputes to excite the impatient hopes of the aspirant till they delivered him into the hands of their associate Maximus the boldest and most skilful master of the Theurgic science </s>
<s> By his hands Julian was secretly initiated at Ephesus in the twentieth year of his age </s>
<s> His residence at Athens confirmed this unnatural alliance of philosophy and superstition </s>
<s> He obtained the privilege of a solemn initiation into the mysteries of Eleusis which amidst the general decay of the Grecian worship still retained some vestiges of their primaeval sanctity and such was the zeal of Julian that he afterwards invited the Eleusinian pontiff to the court of Gaul for the sole purpose of consummating by mystic rites and sacrifices the great work of his sanctification </s>
<s> As these ceremonies were performed in the depth of caverns and in the silence of the night and as the inviolable secret of the mysteries was preserved by the discretion of the initiated I shall not presume to describe the horrid sounds and fiery apparitions which were presented to the senses or the imagination of the credulous aspirant 24 till the visions of comfort and knowledge broke upon him in a blaze of celestial light </s>
<s> 25 In the caverns of Ephesus and Eleusis the mind of Julian was penetrated with sincere deep and unalterable enthusiasm though he might sometimes exhibit the vicissitudes of pious fraud and hypocrisy which may be observed or at least suspected in the characters of the most conscientious fanatics </s>
<s> From that moment he consecrated his life to the service of the gods and while the occupations of war of government and of study seemed to claim the whole measure of his time a stated portion of the hours of the night was invariably reserved for the exercise of private devotion </s>
<s> The temperance which adorned the severe manners of the soldier and the philosopher was connected with some strict and frivolous rules of religious abstinence and it was in honor of Pan or Mercury of Hecate or Isis that Julian on particular days denied himself the use of some particular food which might have been offensive to his tutelar deities </s>
<s> By these voluntary fasts he prepared his senses and his understanding for the frequent and familiar visits with which he was honored by the celestial powers </s>
<s> Notwithstanding the modest silence of Julian himself we may learn from his faithful friend the orator Libanius that he lived in a perpetual intercourse with the gods and goddesses that they descended upon earth to enjoy the conversation of their favorite hero that they gently interrupted his slumbers by touching his hand or his hair that they warned him of every impending danger and conducted him by their infallible wisdom in every action of his life and that he had acquired such an intimate knowledge of his heavenly guests as readily to distinguish the voice of Jupiter from that of Minerva and the form of Apollo from the figure of Hercules </s>

<s> From the zeal and virtues of their royal proselyte they fondly expected the cure of every evil and the restoration of every blessing and instead of disapproving of the ardor of their pious wishes Julian ingenuously confessed that he was ambitious to attain a situation in which he might be useful to his country and to his religion </s>
<s> But this religion was viewed with a hostile eye by the successor of Constantine whose capricious passions altercately saved and threatened the life of Julian </s>
<s> The arts of magic and divination were strictly prohibited under a despotic government which condescended to fear them and if the Pagans were reluctantly indulged in the exercise of their superstition the rank of Julian would have excepted him from the general toleration </s>
<s> The apostate soon became the presumptive heir of the monarchy and his death could alone have appeased the just apprehensions of the Christians </s>
<s> 28 But the young prince who aspired to the glory of a hero rather than of a martyr consulted his safety by dissembling his religion and the easy temper of polytheism permitted him to join in the public worship of a sect which he inwardly despised </s>
<s> Libanius has considered the hypocrisy of his friend as a subject not of censure but of praise </s>
<s> As the statues of the gods says that orator which have been defiled with filth are again placed in a magnificent temple so the beauty of truth was seated in the mind of Julian after it had been purified from the errors and follies of his education </s>

<s> Very different from the ass in Aesop who disguised himself with a lion's hide our lion was obliged to conceal himself under the skin of an ass and while he embraced the dictates of reason to obey the laws of prudence and necessity </s>
<s> 29 The dissimulation of Julian lasted about ten years from his secret initiation at Ephesus to the beginning of the civil war when he declared himself at once the implacable enemy of Christ and of Constantius </s>
<s> This state of constraint might contribute to strengthen his devotion and as soon as he had satisfied the obligation of assisting on solemn festivals at the assemblies of the Christians Julian returned with the impatience of a lover to burn his free and voluntary incense on the domestic chapels of Jupiter and Mercury </s>

<s> But as a philosopher it was incumbent on him to justify his dissent from Christianity which was supported by the number of its converts by the chain of prophecy the splendor of or miracles and the weight of evidence </s>

<s> But in the assiduous prosecution of these theological studies the emperor of the Romans imbibed the illiberal prejudices and passions of a polemic divine </s>
<s> He contracted an irrevocable obligation to maintain and propagate his religious opinions and whilst he secretly applauded the strength and dexterity with which he wielded the weapons of controversy he was tempted to distrust the sincerity or to despise the understandings of his antagonists who could obstinately resist the force of reason and eloquence </s>

<s> 23 but Libanius cannot be accused of flattery to a dead prince.] The Christians who beheld with horror and indignation the apostasy of Julian had much more to fear from his power than from his arguments </s>
<s> The pagans who were conscious of his fervent zeal expected perhaps with impatience that the flames of persecution should be immediately kindled against the enemies of the gods and that the ingenious malice of Julian would invent some cruel refinements of death and torture which had been unknown to the rude and inexperienced fury of his predecessors </s>
<s> But the hopes as well as the fears of the religious factions were apparently disappointed by the prudent humanity of a prince 33 who was careful of his own fame of the public peace and of the rights of mankind </s>
<s> Instructed by history and reflection Julian was persuaded that if the diseases of the body may sometimes be cured by salutary violence neither steel nor fire can eradicate the erroneous opinions of the mind </s>
<s> The reluctant victim may be dragged to the foot of the altar but the heart still abhors and disclaims the sacrilegious act of the hand </s>
<s> Religious obstinacy is hardened and exasperated by oppression and as soon as the persecution subsides those who have yielded are restored as penitents and those who have resisted are honored as saints and martyrs </s>
<s> If Julian adopted the unsuccessful cruelty of Diocletian and his colleagues he was sensible that he should stain his memory with the name of a tyrant and add new glories to the Catholic church which had derived strength and increase from the severity of the pagan magistrates </s>
<s> Actuated by these motives and apprehensive of disturbing the repose of an unsettled reign Julian surprised the world by an edict which was not unworthy of a statesman or a philosopher </s>
<s> He extended to all the inhabitants of the Roman world the benefits of a free and equal toleration and the only hardship which he inflicted on the Christians was to deprive them of the power of tormenting their fellowsubjects whom they stigmatized with the odious titles of idolaters and heretics </s>
<s> The pagans received a gracious permission or rather an express order to open All their temples 34 and they were at once delivered from the oppressive laws and arbitrary vexations which they had sustained under the reign of Constantine and of his sons </s>

<s> As the business of the state prevented the emperor from joining every day in the public devotion of his subjects he dedicated a domestic chapel to his tutelar deity the Sun his gardens were filled with statues and altars of the gods and each apartment of the palace displaced the appearance of a magnificent temple </s>

<s> Instead of maintaining the lofty state of a monarch distinguished by the splendor of his purple and encompassed by the golden shields of his guards Julian solicited with respectful eagerness the meanest offices which contributed to the worship of the gods </s>
<s> Amidst the sacred but licentious crowd of priests of inferior ministers and of female dancers who were dedicated to the service of the temple it was the business of the emperor to bring the wood to blow the fire to handle the knife to slaughter the victim and thrusting his bloody hands into the bowels of the expiring animal to draw forth the heart or liver and to read with the consummate skill of an haruspex imaginary signs of future events </s>

<s> Yet this expense may appear inconsiderable when it is compared with the splendid presents which were offered either by the hand or by order of the emperor to all the celebrated places of devotion in the Roman world and with the sums allotted to repair and decorate the ancient temples which had suffered the silent decay of time or the recent injuries of Christian rapine </s>

<s> The jurisdiction of the supreme pontiff more especially after that office had been united with the Imperial dignity comprehended the whole extent of the Roman empire </s>
<s> Julian named for his vicars in the several provinces the priests and philosophers whom he esteemed the best qualified to cooperate in the execution of his great design and his pastoral letters 37 if we may use that name still represent a very curious sketch of his wishes and intentions </s>

<s> The exercise of their sacred functions requires an immaculate purity both of mind and body and even when they are dismissed from the temple to the occupations of common life it is incumbent on them to excel in decency and virtue the rest of their fellowcitizens </s>

<s> His studies should be suited to the sanctity of his profession </s>

<s> The impious opinions of the Epicureans and sceptics deserve his abhorrence and contempt 38 but he should diligently study the systems of Pythagoras of Plato and of the Stoics which unanimously teach that there are gods that the world is governed by their providence that their goodness is the source of every temporal blessing and that they have prepared for the human soul a future state of reward or punishment </s>
<s> The Imperial pontiff inculcates in the most persuasive language the duties of benevolence and hospitality exhorts his inferior clergy to recommend the universal practice of those virtues promises to assist their indigence from the public treasury and declares his resolution of establishing hospitals in every city where the poor should be received without any invidious distinction of country or of religion </s>

<s> But if these imaginary plans of reformation had been realized the forced and imperfect copy would have been less beneficial to Paganism than honorable to Christianity </s>

<s> The restoration of the Jewish temple was secretly connected with the ruin of the Christian church </s>
<s> Julian still continued to maintain the freedom of religious worship without distinguishing whether this universal toleration proceeded from his justice or his clemency </s>
<s> He affected to pity the unhappy Christians who were mistaken in the most important object of their lives but his pity was degraded by contempt his contempt was embittered by hatred and the sentiments of Julian were expressed in a style of sarcastic wit which inflicts a deep and deadly wound whenever it issues from the mouth of a sovereign </s>
<s> As he was sensible that the Christians gloried in the name of their Redeemer he countenanced and perhaps enjoined the use of the less honorable appellation of Galilaeans </s>
<s> 85 He declared that by the folly of the Galilaeans whom he describes as a sect of fanatics contemptible to men and odious to the gods the empire had been reduced to the brink of destruction and he insinuates in a public edict that a frantic patient might sometimes be cured by salutary violence </s>
<s> 86 An ungenerous distinction was admitted into the mind and counsels of Julian that according to the difference of their religious sentiments one part of his subjects deserved his favor and friendship while the other was entitled only to the common benefits that his justice could not refuse to an obedient people </s>
<s> According to a principle pregnant with mischief and oppression the emperor transferred to the pontiffs of his own religion the management of the liberal allowances for the public revenue which had been granted to the church by the piety of Constantine and his sons </s>
<s> The proud system of clerical honors and immunities which had been constructed with so much art and labor was levelled to the ground the hopes of testamentary donations were intercepted by the rigor of the laws and the priests of the Christian sect were confounded with the last and most ignominious class of the people </s>
<s> Such of these regulations as appeared necessary to check the ambition and avarice of the ecclesiastics were soon afterwards imitated by the wisdom of an orthodox prince </s>
<s> The peculiar distinctions which policy has bestowed or superstition has lavished on the sacerdotal order must be confined to those priests who profess the religion of the state </s>

<s> The consecrated lands which had increased the patrimony of the sovereign or of the clergy were clearly defined and easily restored </s>
<s> But on these lands and on the ruins of Pagan superstition the Christians had frequently erected their own religious edifices and as it was necessary to remove the church before the temple could be rebuilt the justice and piety of the emperor were applauded by one party while the other deplored and execrated his sacrilegious violence </s>
<s> 97 After the ground was cleared the restitution of those stately structures which had been levelled with the dust and of the precious ornaments which had been converted to Christian uses swelled into a very large account of damages and debt </s>
<s> The authors of the injury had neither the ability nor the inclination to discharge this accumulated demand and the impartial wisdom of a legislator would have been displayed in balancing the adverse claims and complaints by an equitable and temperate arbitration </s>
<s> But the whole empire and particularly the East was thrown into confusion by the rash edicts of Julian and the Pagan magistrates inflamed by zeal and revenge abused the rigorous privilege of the Roman law which substitutes in the place of his inadequate property the person of the insolvent debtor </s>

<s> A magnificent church was erected over his remains a portion of the sacred lands was usurped for the maintenance of the clergy and for the burial of the Christians at Antioch who were ambitious of lying at the feet of their bishop and the priests of Apollo retired with their affrighted and indignant votaries </s>
<s> As soon as another revolution seemed to restore the fortune of Paganism the church of St. Babylas was demolished and new buildings were added to the mouldering edifice which had been raised by the piety of Syrian kings </s>
<s> But the first and most serious care of Julian was to deliver his oppressed deity from the odious presence of the dead and living Christians who had so effectually suppressed the voice of fraud or enthusiasm </s>
<s> 113 The scene of infection was purified according to the forms of ancient rituals the bodies were decently removed and the ministers of the church were permitted to convey the remains of St. Babylas to their former habitation within the walls of Antioch </s>
<s> The modest behavior which might have assuaged the jealousy of a hostile government was neglected on this occasion by the zeal of the Christians </s>

<s> During the night which terminated this indiscreet procession the temple of Daphne was in flames the statue of Apollo was consumed and the walls of the edifice were left a naked and awful monument of ruin </s>
<s> The Christians of Antioch asserted with religious confidence that the powerful intercession of St. Babylas had pointed the lightnings of heaven against the devoted roof but as Julian was reduced to the alternative of believing either a crime or a miracle he chose without hesitation without evidence but with some color of probability to impute the fire of Daphne to the revenge of the Galilaeans </s>

<s> But if the deadly spirit of fanaticism perverted the heart and understanding of a virtuous prince it must at the same time be confessed that the real sufferings of the Christians were inflamed and magnified by human passions and religious enthusiasm </s>
<s> The meekness and resignation which had distinguished the primitive disciples of the gospel was the object of the applause rather than of the imitation of their successors </s>
<s> The Christians who had now possessed above forty years the civil and ecclesiastical government of the empire had contracted the insolent vices of prosperity 135 and the habit of believing that the saints alone were entitled to reign over the earth </s>
<s> As soon as the enmity of Julian deprived the clergy of the privileges which had been conferred by the favor of Constantine they complained of the most cruel oppression and the free toleration of idolaters and heretics was a subject of grief and scandal to the orthodox party </s>
<s> 136 The acts of violence which were no longer countenanced by the magistrates were still committed by the zeal of the people </s>
<s> At Pessinus the altar of Cybele was overturned almost in the presence of the emperor and in the city of Caesarea in Cappadocia the temple of Fortune the sole place of worship which had been left to the Pagans was destroyed by the rage of a popular tumult </s>
<s> On these occasions a prince who felt for the honor of the gods was not disposed to interrupt the course of justice and his mind was still more deeply exasperated when he found that the fanatics who had deserved and suffered the punishment of incendiaries were rewarded with the honors of martyrdom </s>
<s> 137 The Christian subjects of Julian were assured of the hostile designs of their sovereign and to their jealous apprehension every circumstance of his government might afford some grounds of discontent and suspicion </s>
<s> In the ordinary administration of the laws the Christians who formed so large a part of the people must frequently be condemned but their indulgent brethren without examining the merits of the cause presumed their innocence allowed their claims and imputed the severity of their judge to the partial malice of religious persecution </s>
<s> 138 These present hardships intolerable as they might appear were represented as a slight prelude of the impending calamities </s>
<s> The Christians considered Julian as a cruel and crafty tyrant who suspended the execution of his revenge till he should return victorious from the Persian war </s>
<s> They expected that as soon as he had triumphed over the foreign enemies of Rome he would lay aside the irksome mask of dissimulation that the amphitheatre would stream with the blood of hermits and bishops and that the Christians who still persevered in the profession of the faith would be deprived of the common benefits of nature and society </s>
<s> 139 Every calumny 140 that could wound the reputation of the Apostate was credulously embraced by the fears and hatred of his adversaries and their indiscreet clamors provoked the temper of a sovereign whom it was their duty to respect and their interest to flatter </s>
<s> They still protested that prayers and tears were their only weapons against the impious tyrant whose head they devoted to the justice of offended Heaven </s>
<s> But they insinuated with sullen resolution that their submission was no longer the effect of weakness and that in the imperfect state of human virtue the patience which is founded on principle may be exhausted by persecution </s>
<s> It is impossible to determine how far the zeal of Julian would have prevailed over his good sense and humanity but if we seriously reflect on the strength and spirit of the church we shall be convinced that before the emperor could have extinguished the religion of Christ he must have involved his country in the horrors of a civil war </s>

<s> The philosophical fable which Julian composed under the name of the Caesars 1 is one of the most agreeable and instructive productions of ancient wit </s>
<s> 2 During the freedom and equality of the days of the Saturnalia Romulus prepared a feast for the deities of Olympus who had adopted him as a worthy associate and for the Roman princes who had reigned over his martial people and the vanquished nations of the earth </s>
<s> The immortals were placed in just order on their thrones of state and the table of the Caesars was spread below the Moon in the upper region of the air </s>
<s> The tyrants who would have disgraced the society of gods and men were thrown headlong by the inexorable Nemesis into the Tartarean abyss </s>
<s> The rest of the Caesars successively advanced to their seats and as they passed the vices the defects the blemishes of their respective characters were maliciously noticed by old Silenus a laughing moralist who disguised the wisdom of a philosopher under the mask of a Bacchanal </s>
<s> 3 As soon as the feast was ended the voice of Mercury proclaimed the will of Jupiter that a celestial crown should be the reward of superior merit </s>
<s> Julius Caesar Augustus Trajan and Marcus Antoninus were selected as the most illustrious candidates the effeminate Constantine 4 was not excluded from this honorable competition and the great Alexander was invited to dispute the prize of glory with the Roman heroes </s>
<s> Each of the candidates was allowed to display the merit of his own exploits but in the judgment of the gods the modest silence of Marcus pleaded more powerfully than the elaborate orations of his haughty rivals </s>
<s> When the judges of this awful contest proceeded to examine the heart and to scrutinize the springs of action the superiority of the Imperial Stoic appeared still more decisive and conspicuous </s>
<s> 5 Alexander and Caesar Augustus Trajan and Constantine acknowledged with a blush that fame or power or pleasure had been the important object of their labors but the gods themselves beheld with reverence and love a virtuous mortal who had practised on the throne the lessons of philosophy and who in a state of human imperfection had aspired to imitate the moral attributes of the Deity </s>
<s> The value of this agreeable composition the Caesars of Julian is enhanced by the rank of the author </s>
<s> A prince who delineates with freedom the vices and virtues of his predecessors subscribes in every line the censure or approbation of his own conduct </s>

<s> 264.] In the cool moments of reflection Julian preferred the useful and benevolent virtues of Antoninus but his ambitious spirit was inflamed by the glory of Alexander and he solicited with equal ardor the esteem of the wise and the applause of the multitude </s>
<s> In the season of life when the powers of the mind and body enjoy the most active vigor the emperor who was instructed by the experience and animated by the success of the German war resolved to signalize his reign by some more splendid and memorable achievement </s>
<s> The ambassadors of the East from the continent of India and the Isle of Ceylon 6 had respectfully saluted the Roman purple </s>
<s> 7 The nations of the West esteemed and dreaded the personal virtues of Julian both in peace and war </s>
<s> He despised the trophies of a Gothic victory and was satisfied that the rapacious Barbarians of the Danube would be restrained from any future violation of the faith of treaties by the terror of his name and the additional fortifications with which he strengthened the Thracian and Illyrian frontiers </s>
<s> The successor of Cyrus and Artaxerxes was the only rival whom he deemed worthy of his arms and he resolved by the final conquest of Persia to chastise the naughty nation which had so long resisted and insulted the majesty of Rome </s>
<s> 9 As soon as the Persian monarch was informed that the throne of Constantius was filed by a prince of a very different character he condescended to make some artful or perhaps sincere overtures towards a negotiation of peace </s>
<s> But the pride of Sapor was astonished by the firmness of Julian who sternly declared that he would never consent to hold a peaceful conference among the flames and ruins of the cities of Mesopotamia and who added with a smile of contempt that it was needless to treat by ambassadors as he himself had determined to visit speedily the court of Persia </s>
<s> The impatience of the emperor urged the diligence of the military preparations </s>
<s> The generals were named and Julian marching from Constantinople through the provinces of Asia Minor arrived at Antioch about eight months after the death of his predecessor </s>
<s> His ardent desire to march into the heart of Persia was checked by the indispensable duty of regulating the state of the empire by his zeal to revive the worship of the gods and by the advice of his wisest friends who represented the necessity of allowing the salutary interval of winter quarters to restore the exhausted strength of the legions of Gaul and the discipline and spirit of the Eastern troops </s>

<s> 11 The warmth of the climate disposed the natives to the most intemperate enjoyment of tranquillity and opulence and the lively licentiousness of the Greeks was blended with the hereditary softness of the Syrians </s>
<s> Fashion was the only law pleasure the only pursuit and the splendor of dress and furniture was the only distinction of the citizens of Antioch </s>
<s> The arts of luxury were honored the serious and manly virtues were the subject of ridicule and the contempt for female modesty and reverent age announced the universal corruption of the capital of the East </s>
<s> The love of spectacles was the taste or rather passion of the Syrians the most skilful artists were procured from the adjacent cities 12 a considerable share of the revenue was devoted to the public amusements and the magnificence of the games of the theatre and circus was considered as the happiness and as the glory of Antioch </s>
<s> The rustic manners of a prince who disdained such glory and was insensible of such happiness soon disgusted the delicacy of his subjects and the effeminate Orientals could neither imitate nor admire the severe simplicity which Julian always maintained and sometimes affected </s>
<s> The days of festivity consecrated by ancient custom to the honor of the gods were the only occasions in which Julian relaxed his philosophic severity and those festivals were the only days in which the Syrians of Antioch could reject the allurements of pleasure </s>
<s> The majority of the people supported the glory of the Christian name which had been first invented by their ancestors 13 they contended themselves with disobeying the moral precepts but they were scrupulously attached to the speculative doctrines of their religion </s>
<s> The church of Antioch was distracted by heresy and schism but the Arians and the Athanasians the followers of Meletius and those of Paulinus 14 were actuated by the same pious hatred of their common adversary </s>

<s> His subjects complained with superstitious indignation that famine had pursued the emperor's steps from Constantinople to Antioch and the discontent of a hungry people was exasperated by the injudicious attempt to relieve their distress </s>
<s> The inclemency of the season had affected the harvests of Syria and the price of bread 15 in the markets of Antioch had naturally risen in proportion to the scarcity of corn </s>
<s> But the fair and reasonable proportion was soon violated by the rapacious arts of monopoly </s>
<s> In this unequal contest in which the produce of the land is claimed by one party as his exclusive property is used by another as a lucrative object of trade and is required by a third for the daily and necessary support of life all the profits of the intermediate agents are accumulated on the head of the defenceless customers </s>
<s> The hardships of their situation were exaggerated and increased by their own impatience and anxiety and the apprehension of a scarcity gradually produced the appearances of a famine </s>
<s> When the luxurious citizens of Antioch complained of the high price of poultry and fish Julian publicly declared that a frugal city ought to be satisfied with a regular supply of wine oil and bread but he acknowledged that it was the duty of a sovereign to provide for the subsistence of his people </s>
<s> With this salutary view the emperor ventured on a very dangerous and doubtful step of fixing by legal authority the value of corn </s>
<s> He enacted that in a time of scarcity it should be sold at a price which had seldom been known in the most plentiful years and that his own example might strengthen his laws he sent into the market four hundred and twenty two thousand modii or measures which were drawn by his order from the granaries of Hierapolis of Chalcis and even of Egypt </s>
<s> The consequences might have been foreseen and were soon felt </s>
<s> The Imperial wheat was purchased by the rich merchants the proprietors of land or of corn withheld from the city the accustomed supply and the small quantities that appeared in the market were secretly sold at an advanced and illegal price </s>
<s> Julian still continued to applaud his own policy treated the complaints of the people as a vain and ungrateful murmur and convinced Antioch that he had inherited the obstinacy though not the cruelty of his brother Gallus </s>
<s> 16 The remonstrances of the municipal senate served only to exasperate his inflexible mind </s>
<s> He was persuaded perhaps with truth that the senators of Antioch who possessed lands or were concerned in trade had themselves contributed to the calamities of their country and he imputed the disrespectful boldness which they assumed to the sense not of public duty but of private interest </s>
<s> The whole body consisting of two hundred of the most noble and wealthy citizens were sent under a guard from the palace to the prison and though they were permitted before the close of evening to return to their respective houses 17 the emperor himself could not obtain the forgiveness which he had so easily granted </s>
<s> The same grievances were still the subject of the same complaints which were industriously circulated by the wit and levity of the Syrian Greeks </s>
<s> During the licentious days of the Saturnalia the streets of the city resounded with insolent songs which derided the laws the religion the personal conduct and even the beard of the emperor the spirit of Antioch was manifested by the connivance of the magistrates and the applause of the multitude </s>
<s> 18 The disciple of Socrates was too deeply affected by these popular insults but the monarch endowed with a quick sensibility and possessed of absolute power refused his passions the gratification of revenge </s>
<s> A tyrant might have proscribed without distinction the lives and fortunes of the citizens of Antioch and the unwarlike Syrians must have patiently submitted to the lust the rapaciousness and the cruelty of the faithful legions of Gaul </s>
<s> A milder sentence might have deprived the capital of the East of its honors and privileges and the courtiers perhaps the subjects of Julian would have applauded an act of justice which asserted the dignity of the supreme magistrate of the republic </s>
<s> 19 But instead of abusing or exerting the authority of the state to revenge his personal injuries Julian contented himself with an inoffensive mode of retaliation which it would be in the power of few princes to employ </s>
<s> He had been insulted by satires and libels in his turn he composed under the title of the Enemy of the Beard an ironical confession of his own faults and a severe satire on the licentious and effeminate manners of Antioch </s>
<s> This Imperial reply was publicly exposed before the gates of the palace and the Misopogon 20 still remains a singular monument of the resentment the wit the humanity and the indiscretion of Julian </s>
<s> Though he affected to laugh he could not forgive </s>
<s> 21 His contempt was expressed and his revenge might be gratified by the nomination of a governor 22 worthy only of such subjects and the emperor forever renouncing the ungrateful city proclaimed his resolution to pass the ensuing winter at Tarsus in Cilicia </s>

<s> Libanius in a professed oration invites him to return to his loyal and penitent city of Antioch.] Yet Antioch possessed one citizen whose genius and virtues might atone in the opinion of Julian for the vice and folly of his country </s>
<s> The sophist Libanius was born in the capital of the East he publicly professed the arts of rhetoric and declamation at Nice Nicomedia Constantinople Athens and during the remainder of his life at Antioch </s>
<s> His school was assiduously frequented by the Grecian youth his disciples who sometimes exceeded the number of eighty celebrated their incomparable master and the jealousy of his rivals who persecuted him from one city to another confirmed the favorable opinion which Libanius ostentatiously displayed of his superior merit </s>
<s> The preceptors of Julian had extorted a rash but solemn assurance that he would never attend the lectures of their adversary the curiosity of the royal youth was checked and inflamed he secretly procured the writings of this dangerous sophist and gradually surpassed in the perfect imitation of his style the most laborious of his domestic pupils </s>
<s> 24 When Julian ascended the throne he declared his impatience to embrace and reward the Syrian sophist who had preserved in a degenerate age the Grecian purity of taste of manners and of religion </s>
<s> The emperor's prepossession was increased and justified by the discreet pride of his favorite </s>
<s> Instead of pressing with the foremost of the crowd into the palace of Constantinople Libanius calmly expected his arrival at Antioch withdrew from court on the first symptoms of coldness and indifference required a formal invitation for each visit and taught his sovereign an important lesson that he might command the obedience of a subject but that he must deserve the attachment of a friend </s>
<s> The sophists of every age despising or affecting to despise the accidental distinctions of birth and fortune 25 reserve their esteem for the superior qualities of the mind with which they themselves are so plentifully endowed </s>

<s> Part II </s>
<s> The martial impatience of Julian urged him to take the field in the beginning of the spring and he dismissed with contempt and reproach the senate of Antioch who accompanied the emperor beyond the limits of their own territory to which he was resolved never to return </s>
<s> After a laborious march of two days 29 he halted on the third at Beraea or Aleppo where he had the mortification of finding a senate almost entirely Christian who received with cold and formal demonstrations of respect the eloquent sermon of the apostle of paganism </s>
<s> The son of one of the most illustrious citizens of Beraea who had embraced either from interest or conscience the religion of the emperor was disinherited by his angry parent </s>
<s> The father and the son were invited to the Imperial table </s>
<s> Julian placing himself between them attempted without success to inculcate the lesson and example of toleration supported with affected calmness the indiscreet zeal of the aged Christian who seemed to forget the sentiments of nature and the duty of a subject and at length turning towards the afflicted youth Since you have lost a father said he for my sake it is incumbent on me to supply his place </s>
<s> 30 The emperor was received in a manner much more agreeable to his wishes at Batnae a small town pleasantly seated in a grove of cypresses about twenty miles from the city of Hierapolis </s>
<s> The solemn rites of sacrifice were decently prepared by the inhabitants of Batnae who seemed attached to the worship of their tutelar deities Apollo and Jupiter but the serious piety of Julian was offended by the tumult of their applause and he too clearly discerned that the smoke which arose from their altars was the incense of flattery rather than of devotion </s>
<s> The ancient and magnificent temple which had sanctified for so many ages the city of Hierapolis 31 no longer subsisted and the consecrated wealth which afforded a liberal maintenance to more than three hundred priests might hasten its downfall </s>
<s> Yet Julian enjoyed the satisfaction of embracing a philosopher and a friend whose religious firmness had withstood the pressing and repeated solicitations of Constantius and Gallus as often as those princes lodged at his house in their passage through Hierapolis </s>
<s> In the hurry of military preparation and the careless confidence of a familiar correspondence the zeal of Julian appears to have been lively and uniform </s>
<s> He had now undertaken an important and difficult war and the anxiety of the event rendered him still more attentive to observe and register the most trifling presages from which according to the rules of divination any knowledge of futurity could be derived </s>

<s> 35 If the inclinations of Julian had been similar to those of his predecessor he might have wasted the active and important season of the year in the circus of Samosata or in the churches of Edessa </s>
<s> But as the warlike emperor instead of Constantius had chosen Alexander for his model he advanced without delay to Carrhae 36 a very ancient city of Mesopotamia at the distance of fourscore miles from Hierapolis </s>
<s> The temple of the Moon attracted the devotion of Julian but the halt of a few days was principally employed in completing the immense preparations of the Persian war </s>
<s> The secret of the expedition had hitherto remained in his own breast but as Carrhae is the point of separation of the two great roads he could no longer conceal whether it was his design to attack the dominions of Sapor on the side of the Tigris or on that of the Euphrates </s>
<s> The emperor detached an army of thirty thousand men under the command of his kinsman Procopius and of Sebastian who had been duke of Egypt </s>
<s> They were ordered to direct their march towards Nisibis and to secure the frontier from the desultory incursions of the enemy before they attempted the passage of the Tigris </s>
<s> Their subsequent operations were left to the discretion of the generals but Julian expected that after wasting with fire and sword the fertile districts of Media and Adiabene they might arrive under the walls of Ctesiphon at the same time that he himself advancing with equal steps along the banks of the Euphrates should besiege the capital of the Persian monarchy </s>
<s> The success of this wellconcerted plan depended in a great measure on the powerful and ready assistance of the king of Armenia who without exposing the safety of his own dominions might detach an army of four thousand horse and twenty thousand foot to the assistance of the Romans </s>
<s> 37 But the feeble Arsaces Tiranus 38 king of Armenia had degenerated still more shamefully than his father Chosroes from the manly virtues of the great Tiridates and as the pusillanimous monarch was averse to any enterprise of danger and glory he could disguise his timid indolence by the more decent excuses of religion and gratitude </s>
<s> He expressed a pious attachment to the memory of Constantius from whose hands he had received in marriage Olympias the daughter of the praefect Ablavius and the alliance of a female who had been educated as the destined wife of the emperor Constans exalted the dignity of a Barbarian king </s>
<s> 39 Tiranus professed the Christian religion he reigned over a nation of Christians and he was restrained by every principle of conscience and interest from contributing to the victory which would consummate the ruin of the church </s>
<s> The alienated mind of Tiranus was exasperated by the indiscretion of Julian who treated the king of Armenia as his slave and as the enemy of the gods </s>
<s> The haughty and threatening style of the Imperial mandates 40 awakened the secret indignation of a prince who in the humiliating state of dependence was still conscious of his royal descent from the Arsacides the lords of the East and the rivals of the Roman power </s>

<s> The legions appeared to direct their march towards Nisibis and the Tigris </s>
<s> On a sudden they wheeled to the right traversed the level and naked plain of Carrhae and reached on the third day the banks of the Euphrates where the strong town of Nicephorium or Callinicum had been founded by the Macedonian kings </s>
<s> From thence the emperor pursued his march above ninety miles along the winding stream of the Euphrates till at length about one month after his departure from Antioch he discovered the towers of Circesium the extreme limit of the Roman dominions </s>
<s> The army of Julian the most numerous that any of the Caesars had ever led against Persia consisted of sixtyfive thousand effective and welldisciplined soldiers </s>
<s> The veteran bands of cavalry and infantry of Romans and Barbarians had been selected from the different provinces and a just preeminence of loyalty and valor was claimed by the hardy Gauls who guarded the throne and person of their beloved prince </s>
<s> A formidable body of Scythian auxiliaries had been transported from another climate and almost from another world to invade a distant country of whose name and situation they were ignorant </s>
<s> The love of rapine and war allured to the Imperial standard several tribes of Saracens or roving Arabs whose service Julian had commanded while he sternly refuse the payment of the accustomed subsidies </s>
<s> The broad channel of the Euphrates 41 was crowded by a fleet of eleven hundred ships destined to attend the motions and to satisfy the wants of the Roman army </s>
<s> The military strength of the fleet was composed of fifty armed galleys and these were accompanied by an equal number of flatbottomed boats which might occasionally be connected into the form of temporary bridges </s>
<s> The rest of the ships partly constructed of timber and partly covered with raw hides were laden with an almost inexhaustible supply of arms and engines of utensils and provisions </s>
<s> The vigilant humanity of Julian had embarked a very large magazine of vinegar and biscuit for the use of the soldiers but he prohibited the indulgence of wine and rigorously stopped a long string of superfluous camels that attempted to follow the rear of the army </s>
<s> The River Chaboras falls into the Euphrates at Circesium 42 and as soon as the trumpet gave the signal of march the Romans passed the little stream which separated two mighty and hostile empires </s>
<s> The custom of ancient discipline required a military oration and Julian embraced every opportunity of displaying his eloquence </s>
<s> He animated the impatient and attentive legions by the example of the inflexible courage and glorious triumphs of their ancestors </s>
<s> He excited their resentment by a lively picture of the insolence of the Persians and he exhorted them to imitate his firm resolution either to extirpate that perfidious nation or to devote his life in the cause of the republic </s>
<s> The eloquence of Julian was enforced by a donative of one hundred and thirty pieces of silver to every soldier and the bridge of the Chaboras was instantly cut away to convince the troops that they must place their hopes of safety in the success of their arms </s>

<s> 17.] From the moment that the Romans entered the enemy's country 44 the country of an active and artful enemy the order of march was disposed in three columns </s>
<s> 45 The strength of the infantry and consequently of the whole army was placed in the centre under the peculiar command of their mastergeneral Victor </s>
<s> On the right the brave Nevitta led a column of several legions along the banks of the Euphrates and almost always in sight of the fleet </s>
<s> The left flank of the army was protected by the column of cavalry </s>
<s> Hormisdas and Arinthaeus were appointed generals of the horse and the singular adventures of Hormisdas 46 are not undeserving of our notice </s>
<s> He was a Persian prince of the royal race of the Sassanides who in the troubles of the minority of Sapor had escaped from prison to the hospitable court of the great Constantine </s>
<s> Hormisdas at first excited the compassion and at length acquired the esteem of his new masters his valor and fidelity raised him to the military honors of the Roman service and though a Christian he might indulge the secret satisfaction of convincing his ungrateful country than at oppressed subject may prove the most dangerous enemy </s>
<s> Such was the disposition of the three principal columns </s>
<s> The front and flanks of the army were covered by Lucilianus with a flying detachment of fifteen hundred lightarmed soldiers whose active vigilance observed the most distant signs and conveyed the earliest notice of any hostile approach </s>
<s> Dagalaiphus and Secundinus duke of Osrhoene conducted the troops of the rearguard the baggage securely proceeded in the intervals of the columns and the ranks from a motive either of use or ostentation were formed in such open order that the whole line of march extended almost ten miles </s>
<s> The ordinary post of Julian was at the head of the centre column but as he preferred the duties of a general to the state of a monarch he rapidly moved with a small escort of light cavalry to the front the rear the flanks wherever his presence could animate or protect the march of the Roman army </s>
<s> The country which they traversed from the Chaboras to the cultivated lands of Assyria may be considered as a part of the desert of Arabia a dry and barren waste which could never be improved by the most powerful arts of human industry </s>
<s> Julian marched over the same ground which had been trod above seven hundred years before by the footsteps of the younger Cyrus and which is described by one of the companions of his expedition the sage and heroic Xenophon </s>
<s> 47 The country was a plain throughout as even as the sea and full of wormwood and if any other kind of shrubs or reeds grew there they had all an aromatic smell but no trees could be seen </s>
<s> Bustards and ostriches antelopes and wild asses 48 appeared to be the only inhabitants of the desert and the fatigues of the march were alleviated by the amusements of the chase </s>

<s> The warlike inhabitants of Anatho showed a disposition to stop the march of a Roman emperor till they were diverted from such fatal presumption by the mild exhortations of Prince Hormisdas and the approaching terrors of the fleet and army </s>

<s> Part III </s>
<s> The fields of Assyria were devoted by Julian to the calamities of war and the philosopher retaliated on a guiltless people the acts of rapine and cruelty which had been committed by their haughty master in the Roman provinces </s>
<s> The trembling Assyrians summoned the rivers to their assistance and completed with their own hands the ruin of their country </s>
<s> The roads were rendered impracticable a flood of waters was poured into the camp and during several days the troops of Julian were obliged to contend with the most discouraging hardships </s>
<s> But every obstacle was surmounted by the perseverance of the legionaries who were inured to toil as well as to danger and who felt themselves animated by the spirit of their leader </s>
<s> The damage was gradually repaired the waters were restored to their proper channels whole groves of palmtrees were cut down and placed along the broken parts of the road and the army passed over the broad and deeper canals on bridges of floating rafts which were supported by the help of bladders </s>
<s> Two cities of Assyria presumed to resist the arms of a Roman emperor and they both paid the severe penalty of their rashness </s>
<s> At the distance of fifty miles from the royal residence of Ctesiphon Perisabor or Anbar held the second rank in the province a city large populous and well fortified surrounded with a double wall almost encompassed by a branch of the Euphrates and defended by the valor of a numerous garrison </s>
<s> The exhortations of Hormisdas were repulsed with contempt and the ears of the Persian prince were wounded by a just reproach that unmindful of his royal birth he conducted an army of strangers against his king and country </s>
<s> The Assyrians maintained their loyalty by a skilful as well as vigorous defence till the lucky stroke of a batteringram having opened a large breach by shattering one of the angles of the wall they hastily retired into the fortifications of the interior citadel </s>
<s> The soldiers of Julian rushed impetuously into the town and after the full gratification of every military appetite Perisabor was reduced to ashes and the engines which assaulted the citadel were planted on the ruins of the smoking houses </s>
<s> The contest was continued by an incessant and mutual discharge of missile weapons and the superiority which the Romans might derive from the mechanical powers of their balistae and catapultae was counterbalanced by the advantage of the ground on the side of the besieged </s>
<s> But as soon as an Helepolis had been constructed which could engage on equal terms with the loftiest ramparts the tremendous aspect of a moving turret that would leave no hope of resistance or mercy terrified the defenders of the citadel into an humble submission and the place was surrendered only two days after Julian first appeared under the walls of Perisabor </s>
<s> Two thousand five hundred persons of both sexes the feeble remnant of a flourishing people were permitted to retire the plentiful magazines of corn of arms and of splendid furniture were partly distributed among the troops and partly reserved for the public service the useless stores were destroyed by fire or thrown into the stream of the Euphrates and the fate of Amida was revenged by the total ruin of Perisabor </s>

<s> Victor at the head of the cavalry and of a detachment of heavyarmed foot was ordered to clear the country as far as the banks of the Tigris and the suburbs of Ctesiphon </s>
<s> The conduct of the attack was assumed by Julian himself who seemed to place his whole dependence in the military engines which he erected against the walls while he secretly contrived a more efficacious method of introducing his troops into the heart of the city Under the direction of Nevitta and Dagalaiphus the trenches were opened at a considerable distance and gradually prolonged as far as the edge of the ditch </s>
<s> The ditch was speedily filled with earth and by the incessant labor of the troops a mine was carried under the foundations of the walls and sustained at sufficient intervals by props of timber </s>
<s> Three chosen cohorts advancing in a single file silently explored the dark and dangerous passage till their intrepid leader whispered back the intelligence that he was ready to issue from his confinement into the streets of the hostile city </s>
<s> Julian checked their ardor that he might insure their success and immediately diverted the attention of the garrison by the tumult and clamor of a general assault </s>
<s> The Persians who from their walls contemptuously beheld the progress of an impotent attack celebrated with songs of triumph the glory of Sapor and ventured to assure the emperor that he might ascend the starry mansion of Ormusd before he could hope to take the impregnable city of Maogamalcha </s>
<s> The city was already taken </s>
<s> History has recorded the name of a private soldier the first who ascended from the mine into a deserted tower </s>
<s> The passage was widened by his companions who pressed forwards with impatient valor </s>
<s> Fifteen hundred enemies were already in the midst of the city </s>
<s> The astonished garrison abandoned the walls and their only hope of safety the gates were instantly burst open and the revenge of the soldier unless it were suspended by lust or avarice was satiated by an undistinguishing massacre </s>
<s> The governor who had yielded on a promise of mercy was burnt alive a few days afterwards on a charge of having uttered some disrespectful words against the honor of Prince Hormisdas </s>
<s> The fortifications were razed to the ground and not a vestige was left that the city of Maogamalcha had ever existed </s>
<s> The neighborhood of the capital of Persia was adorned with three stately palaces laboriously enriched with every production that could gratify the luxury and pride of an Eastern monarch </s>
<s> The pleasant situation of the gardens along the banks of the Tigris was improved according to the Persian taste by the symmetry of flowers fountains and shady walks and spacious parks were enclosed for the reception of the bears lions and wild boars which were maintained at a considerable expense for the pleasure of the royal chase </s>
<s> The park walls were broken down the savage game was abandoned to the darts of the soldiers and the palaces of Sapor were reduced to ashes by the command of the Roman emperor </s>

<s> When the Romans marched through the flat and flooded country their sovereign on foot at the head of his legions shared their fatigues and animated their diligence </s>

<s> The two sieges allowed him some remarkable opportunities of signalizing his personal valor which in the improved state of the military art can seldom be exerted by a prudent general </s>
<s> The emperor stood before the citadel before the citadel of Perisabor insensible of his extreme danger and encouraged his troops to burst open the gates of iron till he was almost overwhelmed under a cloud of missile weapons and huge stones that were directed against his person </s>
<s> As he examined the exterior fortifications of Maogamalcha two Persians devoting themselves for their country suddenly rushed upon him with drawn cimeters the emperor dexterously received their blows on his uplifted shield and with a steady and wellaimed thrust laid one of his adversaries dead at his feet </s>

<s> But the reduction or even the siege of the capital of Persia was still at a distance nor can the military conduct of the emperor be clearly apprehended without a knowledge of the country which was the theatre of his bold and skilful operations </s>
<s> 65 Twenty miles to the south of Bagdad and on the eastern bank of the Tigris the curiosity of travellers has observed some ruins of the palaces of Ctesiphon which in the time of Julian was a great and populous city </s>
<s> The name and glory of the adjacent Seleucia were forever extinguished and the only remaining quarter of that Greek colony had resumed with the Assyrian language and manners the primitive appellation of Coche </s>
<s> Coche was situate on the western side of the Tigris but it was naturally considered as a suburb of Ctesiphon with which we may suppose it to have been connected by a permanent bridge of boats </s>
<s> The united parts contribute to form the common epithet of Al Modain the cities which the Orientals have bestowed on the winter residence of the Sassinadees and the whole circumference of the Persian capital was strongly fortified by the waters of the river by lofty walls and by impracticable morasses </s>
<s> Near the ruins of Seleucia the camp of Julian was fixed and secured by a ditch and rampart against the sallies of the numerous and enterprising garrison of Coche </s>
<s> In this fruitful and pleasant country the Romans were plentifully supplied with water and forage and several forts which might have embarrassed the motions of the army submitted after some resistance to the efforts of their valor </s>
<s> The fleet passed from the Euphrates into an artificial derivation of that river which pours a copious and navigable stream into the Tigris at a small distance below the great city </s>
<s> If they had followed this royal canal which bore the name of NaharMalcha 66 the intermediate situation of Coche would have separated the fleet and army of Julian and the rash attempt of steering against the current of the Tigris and forcing their way through the midst of a hostile capital must have been attended with the total destruction of the Roman navy </s>
<s> The prudence of the emperor foresaw the danger and provided the remedy </s>
<s> As he had minutely studied the operations of Trajan in the same country he soon recollected that his warlike predecessor had dug a new and navigable canal which leaving Coche on the right hand conveyed the waters of the Nahar Malcha into the river Tigris at some distance above the cities </s>
<s> From the information of the peasants Julian ascertained the vestiges of this ancient work which were almost obliterated by design or accident </s>
<s> By the indefatigable labor of the soldiers a broad and deep channel was speedily prepared for the reception of the Euphrates </s>
<s> A strong dike was constructed to interrupt the ordinary current of the NaharMalcha a flood of waters rushed impetuously into their new bed and the Roman fleet steering their triumphant course into the Tigris derided the vain and ineffectual barriers which the Persians of Ctesiphon had erected to oppose their passage </s>

<s> The stream was broad and rapid the ascent steep and difficult and the intrenchments which had been formed on the ridge of the opposite bank were lined with a numerous army of heavy cuirrasiers dexterous archers and huge elephants who according to the extravagant hyperbole of Libanius could trample with the same ease a field of corn or a legion of Romans </s>
<s> 67 In the presence of such an enemy the construction of a bridge was impracticable and the intrepid prince who instantly seized the only possible expedient concealed his design till the moment of execution from the knowledge of the Barbarians of his own troops and even of his generals themselves </s>
<s> Under the specious pretence of examining the state of the magazines fourscore vessels were gradually unladen and a select detachment apparently destined for some secret expedition was ordered to stand to their arms on the first signal </s>
<s> Julian disguised the silent anxiety of his own mind with smiles of confidence and joy and amused the hostile nations with the spectacle of military games which he insultingly celebrated under the walls of Coche </s>
<s> The day was consecrated to pleasure but as soon as the hour of supper was passed the emperor summoned the generals to his tent and acquainted them that he had fixed that night for the passage of the Tigris </s>
<s> They stood in silent and respectful astonishment but when the venerable Sallust assumed the privilege of his age and experience the rest of the chiefs supported with freedom the weight of his prudent remonstrances </s>
<s> 68 Julian contented himself with observing that conquest and safety depended on the attempt that instead of diminishing the number of their enemies would be increased by successive reenforcements and that a longer delay would neither contract the breadth of the stream nor level the height of the bank </s>
<s> The signal was instantly given and obeyed the most impatient of the legionaries leaped into five vessels that lay nearest to the bank and as they plied their oars with intrepid diligence they were lost after a few moments in the darkness of the night </s>
<s> A flame arose on the opposite side and Julian who too clearly understood that his foremost vessels in attempting to land had been fired by the enemy dexterously converted their extreme danger into a presage of victory </s>
<s> Our fellowsoldiers he eagerly exclaimed are already masters of the bank see they make the appointed signal let us hasten to emulate and assist their courage </s>
<s> The united and rapid motion of a great fleet broke the violence of the current and they reached the eastern shore of the Tigris with sufficient speed to extinguish the flames and rescue their adventurous companions </s>
<s> The difficulties of a steep and lofty ascent were increased by the weight of armor and the darkness of the night </s>
<s> A shower of stones darts and fire was incessantly discharged on the heads of the assailants who after an arduous struggle climbed the bank and stood victorious upon the rampart </s>
<s> As soon as they possessed a more equal field Julian who with his light infantry had led the attack 69 darted through the ranks a skilful and experienced eye his bravest soldiers according to the precepts of Homer 70 were distributed in the front and rear and all the trumpets of the Imperial army sounded to battle </s>
<s> The Romans after sending up a military shout advanced in measured steps to the animating notes of martial music launched their formidable javelins and rushed forwards with drawn swords to deprive the Barbarians by a closer onset of the advantage of their missile weapons </s>
<s> The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight of which the shameful example was given by the principal leader and the Surenas himself </s>
<s> They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city 71 if their general Victor who was dangerously wounded with an arrow had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt which must be fatal if it were not successful </s>
<s> On their side the Romans acknowledged the loss of only seventyfive men while they affirmed that the Barbarians had left on the field of battle two thousand five hundred or even six thousand of their bravest soldiers </s>
<s> The spoil was such as might be expected from the riches and luxury of an Oriental camp large quantities of silver and gold splendid arms and trappings and beds and tables of massy silver </s>
<s> The victorious emperor distributed as the rewards of valor some honorable gifts civic and mural and naval crowns which he and perhaps he alone esteemed more precious than the wealth of Asia </s>

<s> His expectations were disappointed by the treachery of the Armenian king who permitted and most probably directed the desertion of his auxiliary troops from the camp of the Romans 74 and by the dissensions of the two generals who were incapable of forming or executing any plan for the public service </s>
<s> When the emperor had relinquished the hope of this important reenforcement he condescended to hold a council of war and approved after a full debate the sentiment of those generals who dissuaded the siege of Ctesiphon as a fruitless and pernicious undertaking </s>
<s> It is not easy for us to conceive by what arts of fortification a city thrice besieged and taken by the predecessors of Julian could be rendered impregnable against an army of sixty thousand Romans commanded by a brave and experienced general and abundantly supplied with ships provisions battering engines and military stores </s>
<s> But we may rest assured from the love of glory and contempt of danger which formed the character of Julian that he was not discouraged by any trivial or imaginary obstacles </s>
<s> 75 At the very time when he declined the siege of Ctesiphon he rejected with obstinacy and disdain the most flattering offers of a negotiation of peace </s>
<s> Sapor who had been so long accustomed to the tardy ostentation of Constantius was surprised by the intrepid diligence of his successor </s>
<s> As far as the confines of India and Scythia the satraps of the distant provinces were ordered to assemble their troops and to march without delay to the assistance of their monarch </s>
<s> But their preparations were dilatory their motions slow and before Sapor could lead an army into the field he received the melancholy intelligence of the devastation of Assyria the ruin of his palaces and the slaughter of his bravest troops who defended the passage of the Tigris </s>
<s> The pride of royalty was humbled in the dust he took his repasts on the ground and the disorder of his hair expressed the grief and anxiety of his mind </s>
<s> Perhaps he would not have refused to purchase with one half of his kingdom the safety of the remainder and he would have gladly subscribed himself in a treaty of peace the faithful and dependent ally of the Roman conqueror </s>

<s> The honor as well as interest of Julian forbade him to consume his time under the impregnable walls of Ctesiphon and as often as he defied the Barbarians who defended the city to meet him on the open plain they prudently replied that if he desired to exercise his valor he might seek the army of the Great King </s>
<s> He felt the insult and he accepted the advice </s>
<s> Instead of confining his servile march to the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris he resolved to imitate the adventurous spirit of Alexander and boldly to advance into the inland provinces till he forced his rival to contend with him perhaps in the plains of Arbela for the empire of Asia </s>
<s> The magnanimity of Julian was applauded and betrayed by the arts of a noble Persian who in the cause of his country had generously submitted to act a part full of danger of falsehood and of shame </s>
<s> 77 With a train of faithful followers he deserted to the Imperial camp exposed in a specious tale the injuries which he had sustained exaggerated the cruelty of Sapor the discontent of the people and the weakness of the monarchy and confidently offered himself as the hostage and guide of the Roman march </s>
<s> The most rational grounds of suspicion were urged without effect by the wisdom and experience of Hormisdas and the credulous Julian receiving the traitor into his bosom was persuaded to issue a hasty order which in the opinion of mankind appeared to arraign his prudence and to endanger his safety </s>

<s> 81 The power of sails and oars was insufficient it became necessary to tow the ships against the current of the river the strength of twenty thousand soldiers was exhausted in this tedious and servile labor and if the Romans continued to march along the banks of the Tigris they could only expect to return home without achieving any enterprise worthy of the genius or fortune of their leader </s>
<s> If on the contrary it was advisable to advance into the inland country the destruction of the fleet and magazines was the only measure which could save that valuable prize from the hands of the numerous and active troops which might suddenly be poured from the gates of Ctesiphon </s>

<s> The welcome news of the death of Julian which a deserter revealed to the camp of Sapor inspired the desponding monarch with a sudden confidence of victory </s>
<s> He immediately detached the royal cavalry perhaps the ten thousand Immortals 104 to second and support the pursuit and discharged the whole weight of his united forces on the rear guard of the Romans </s>
<s> The rearguard was thrown into disorder the renowned legions which derived their titles from Diocletian and his warlike colleague were broke and trampled down by the elephants and three tribunes lost their lives in attempting to stop the flight of their soldiers </s>
<s> The battle was at length restored by the persevering valor of the Romans the Persians were repulsed with a great slaughter of men and elephants and the army after marching and fighting a long summer's day arrived in the evening at Samara on the banks of the Tigris about one hundred miles above Ctesiphon </s>
<s> 105 On the ensuing day the Barbarians instead of harassing the march attacked the camp of Jovian which had been seated in a deep and sequestered valley </s>
<s> From the hills the archers of Persia insulted and annoyed the wearied legionaries and a body of cavalry which had penetrated with desperate courage through the Praetorian gate was cut in pieces after a doubtful conflict near the Imperial tent </s>
<s> In the succeeding night the camp of Carche was protected by the lofty dikes of the river and the Roman army though incessantly exposed to the vexatious pursuit of the Saracens pitched their tents near the city of Dura 106 four days after the death of Julian </s>
<s> The Tigris was still on their left their hopes and provisions were almost consumed and the impatient soldiers who had fondly persuaded themselves that the frontiers of the empire were not far distant requested their new sovereign that they might be permitted to hazard the passage of the river </s>
<s> With the assistance of his wisest officers Jovian endeavored to check their rashness by representing that if they possessed sufficient skill and vigor to stem the torrent of a deep and rapid stream they would only deliver themselves naked and defenceless to the Barbarians who had occupied the opposite banks Yielding at length to their clamorous importunities he consented with reluctance that five hundred Gauls and Germans accustomed from their infancy to the waters of the Rhine and Danube should attempt the bold adventure which might serve either as an encouragement or as a warning for the rest of the army </s>

<s> The death of Julian had left the public affairs of the empire in a very doubtful and dangerous situation </s>
<s> The Roman army was saved by an inglorious perhaps a necessary treaty 1 and the first moments of peace were consecrated by the pious Jovian to restore the domestic tranquility of the church and state </s>
<s> The indiscretion of his predecessor instead of reconciling had artfully fomented the religious war and the balance which he affected to preserve between the hostile factions served only to perpetuate the contest by the vicissitudes of hope and fear by the rival claims of ancient possession and actual favor </s>
<s> The Christians had forgotten the spirit of the gospel and the Pagans had imbibed the spirit of the church </s>
<s> In private families the sentiments of nature were extinguished by the blind fury of zeal and revenge the majesty of the laws was violated or abused the cities of the East were stained with blood and the most implacable enemies of the Romans were in the bosom of their country </s>
<s> Jovian was educated in the profession of Christianity and as he marched from Nisibis to Antioch the banner of the Cross the Labarum of Constantine which was again displayed at the head of the legions announced to the people the faith of their new emperor </s>
<s> As soon as he ascended the throne he transmitted a circular epistle to all the governors of provinces in which he confessed the divine truth and secured the legal establishment of the Christian religion </s>
<s> The insidious edicts of Julian were abolished the ecclesiastical immunities were restored and enlarged and Jovian condescended to lament that the distress of the times obliged him to diminish the measure of charitable distributions </s>
<s> 2 The Christians were unanimous in the loud and sincere applause which they bestowed on the pious successor of Julian </s>
<s> But they were still ignorant what creed or what synod he would choose for the standard of orthodoxy and the peace of the church immediately revived those eager disputes which had been suspended during the season of persecution </s>
<s> The episcopal leaders of the contending sects convinced from experience how much their fate would depend on the earliest impressions that were made on the mind of an untutored soldier hastened to the court of Edessa or Antioch </s>
<s> The highways of the East were crowded with Homoousian and Arian and Semi Arian and Eunomian bishops who struggled to outstrip each other in the holy race the apartments of the palace resounded with their clamors and the ears of the prince were assaulted and perhaps astonished by the singular mixture of metaphysical argument and passionate invective </s>
<s> 3 The moderation of Jovian who recommended concord and charity and referred the disputants to the sentence of a future council was interpreted as a symptom of indifference but his attachment to the Nicene creed was at length discovered and declared by the reverence which he expressed for the celestial 4 virtues of the great Athanasius </s>
<s> The intrepid veteran of the faith at the age of seventy had issued from his retreat on the first intelligence of the tyrant's death </s>
<s> The acclamations of the people seated him once more on the archiepiscopal throne and he wisely accepted or anticipated the invitation of Jovian </s>
<s> The venerable figure of Athanasius his calm courage and insinuating eloquence sustained the reputation which he had already acquired in the courts of four successive princes </s>
<s> 5 As soon as he had gained the confidence and secured the faith of the Christian emperor he returned in triumph to his diocese and continued with mature counsels and undiminished vigor to direct ten years longer 6 the ecclesiastical government of Alexandria Egypt and the Catholic church </s>
<s> Before his departure from Antioch he assured Jovian that his orthodox devotion would be rewarded with a long and peaceful reign </s>

<s> Each of them turned away from the object which he disliked and wished to suppress the part of the edict the least honorable in his opinion to the emperor.] In the space of seven months the Roman troops who were now returned to Antioch had performed a march of fifteen hundred miles in which they had endured all the hardships of war of famine and of climate </s>
<s> Notwithstanding their services their fatigues and the approach of winter the timid and impatient Jovian allowed only to the men and horses a respite of six weeks </s>
<s> The emperor could not sustain the indiscreet and malicious raillery of the people of Antioch </s>
<s> 11 He was impatient to possess the palace of Constantinople and to prevent the ambition of some competitor who might occupy the vacant allegiance of Europe </s>
<s> But he soon received the grateful intelligence that his authority was acknowledged from the Thracian Bosphorus to the Atlantic Ocean </s>
<s> By the first letters which he despatched from the camp of Mesopotamia he had delegated the military command of Gaul and Illyricum to Malarich a brave and faithful officer of the nation of the Franks and to his fatherinlaw Count Lucillian who had formerly distinguished his courage and conduct in the defence of Nisibis </s>
<s> Malarich had declined an office to which he thought himself unequal and Lucillian was massacred at Rheims in an accidental mutiny of the Batavian cohorts </s>
<s> 12 But the moderation of Jovinus master general of the cavalry who forgave the intention of his disgrace soon appeased the tumult and confirmed the uncertain minds of the soldiers </s>
<s> The oath of fidelity was administered and taken with loyal acclamations and the deputies of the Western armies 13 saluted their new sovereign as he descended from Mount Taurus to the city of Tyana in Cappadocia </s>
<s> From Tyana he continued his hasty march to Ancyra capital of the province of Galatia where Jovian assumed with his infant son the name and ensigns of the consulship </s>
<s> 14 Dadastana 15 an obscure town almost at an equal distance between Ancyra and Nice was marked for the fatal term of his journey and life </s>
<s> After indulging himself with a plentiful perhaps an intemperate supper he retired to rest and the next morning the emperor Jovian was found dead in his bed </s>
<s> The cause of this sudden death was variously understood </s>
<s> By some it was ascribed to the consequences of an indigestion occasioned either by the quantity of the wine or the quality of the mushrooms which he had swallowed in the evening </s>
<s> According to others he was suffocated in his sleep by the vapor of charcoal which extracted from the walls of the apartment the unwholesome moisture of the fresh plaster </s>
<s> 16 But the want of a regular inquiry into the death of a prince whose reign and person were soon forgotten appears to have been the only circumstance which countenanced the malicious whispers of poison and domestic guilt </s>
<s> 17 The body of Jovian was sent to Constantinople to be interred with his predecessors and the sad procession was met on the road by his wife Charito the daughter of Count Lucillian who still wept the recent death of her father and was hastening to dry her tears in the embraces of an Imperial husband </s>
<s> Her disappointment and grief were imbittered by the anxiety of maternal tenderness </s>
<s> Six weeks before the death of Jovian his infant son had been placed in the curule chair adorned with the title of Nobilissimus and the vain ensigns of the consulship </s>

<s> Several candidates were proposed and after weighing the objections of character or situation they were successively rejected but as soon as the name of Valentinian was pronounced the merit of that officer united the suffrages of the whole assembly and obtained the sincere approbation of Sallust himself </s>

<s> By the habits of chastity and temperance which restrain the appetites and invigorate the faculties Valentinian preserved his own and the public esteem </s>
<s> The avocations of a military life had diverted his youth from the elegant pursuits of literature he was ignorant of the Greek language and the arts of rhetoric but as the mind of the orator was never disconcerted by timid perplexity he was able as often as the occasion prompted him to deliver his decided sentiments with bold and ready elocution </s>
<s> The laws of martial discipline were the only laws that he had studied and he was soon distinguished by the laborious diligence and inflexible severity with which he discharged and enforced the duties of the camp </s>
<s> In the time of Julian he provoked the danger of disgrace by the contempt which he publicly expressed for the reigning religion 22 and it should seem from his subsequent conduct that the indiscreet and unseasonable freedom of Valentinian was the effect of military spirit rather than of Christian zeal </s>
<s> He was pardoned however and still employed by a prince who esteemed his merit 23 and in the various events of the Persian war he improved the reputation which he had already acquired on the banks of the Rhine </s>

<s> Before Valentinian divided the provinces he reformed the administration of the empire </s>
<s> All ranks of subjects who had been injured or oppressed under the reign of Julian were invited to support their public accusations </s>
<s> The silence of mankind attested the spotless integrity of the praefect Sallust 29 and his own pressing solicitations that he might be permitted to retire from the business of the state were rejected by Valentinian with the most honorable expressions of friendship and esteem </s>
<s> But among the favorites of the late emperor there were many who had abused his credulity or superstition and who could no longer hope to be protected either by favor or justice </s>
<s> 30 The greater part of the ministers of the palace and the governors of the provinces were removed from their respective stations yet the eminent merit of some officers was distinguished from the obnoxious crowd and notwithstanding the opposite clamors of zeal and resentment the whole proceedings of this delicate inquiry appear to have been conducted with a reasonable share of wisdom and moderation </s>
<s> 31 The festivity of a new reign received a short and suspicious interruption from the sudden illness of the two princes but as soon as their health was restored they left Constantinople in the beginning of the spring </s>
<s> In the castle or palace of Mediana only three miles from Naissus they executed the solemn and final division of the Roman empire </s>
<s> 32 Valentinian bestowed on his brother the rich praefecture of the East from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia whilst he reserved for his immediate government the warlike praefectures of Illyricum Italy and Gaul from the extremity of Greece to the Caledonian rampart and from the rampart of Caledonia to the foot of Mount Atlas </s>
<s> The provincial administration remained on its former basis but a double supply of generals and magistrates was required for two councils and two courts the division was made with a just regard to their peculiar merit and situation and seven mastergenerals were soon created either of the cavalry or infantry </s>
<s> When this important business had been amicably transacted Valentinian and Valens embraced for the last time </s>

<s> Procopius had been hastily promoted from the obscure station of a tribune and a notary to the joint command of the army of Mesopotamia the public opinion already named him as the successor of a prince who was destitute of natural heirs and a vain rumor was propagated by his friends or his enemies that Julian before the altar of the Moon at Carrhae had privately invested Procopius with the Imperial purple </s>

<s> These useful and innocent occupations were interrupted by the appearance of an officer with a band of soldiers who in the name of his new sovereigns Valentinian and Valens was despatched to conduct the unfortunate Procopius either to a perpetual prison or an ignominious death </s>
<s> His presence of mind procured him a longer respite and a more splendid fate </s>
<s> Without presuming to dispute the royal mandate he requested the indulgence of a few moments to embrace his weeping family and while the vigilance of his guards was relaxed by a plentiful entertainment he dexterously escaped to the seacoast of the Euxine from whence he passed over to the country of Bosphorus </s>
<s> In that sequestered region he remained many months exposed to the hardships of exile of solitude and of want his melancholy temper brooding over his misfortunes and his mind agitated by the just apprehension that if any accident should discover his name the faithless Barbarians would violate without much scruple the laws of hospitality </s>
<s> In a moment of impatience and despair Procopius embarked in a merchant vessel which made sail for Constantinople and boldly aspired to the rank of a sovereign because he was not allowed to enjoy the security of a subject </s>
<s> At first he lurked in the villages of Bithynia continually changing his habitation and his disguise </s>
<s> 36 By degrees he ventured into the capital trusted his life and fortune to the fidelity of two friends a senator and a eunuch and conceived some hopes of success from the intelligence which he obtained of the actual state of public affairs </s>
<s> The body of the people was infected with a spirit of discontent they regretted the justice and the abilities of Sallust who had been imprudently dismissed from the praefecture of the East </s>
<s> They despised the character of Valens which was rude without vigor and feeble without mildness </s>

<s> Their numbers were soon increased by a band of sturdy peasants collected from the adjacent country and Procopius shielded by the arms of his adherents was successively conducted to the tribunal the senate and the palace </s>

<s> 43 Let us not hesitate to indulge a liberal pride that in the present age the enlightened part of Europe has abolished 44 a cruel and odious prejudice which reigned in every climate of the globe and adhered to every system of religious opinions </s>
<s> 45 The nations and the sects of the Roman world admitted with equal credulity and similar abhorrence the reality of that infernal art 46 which was able to control the eternal order of the planets and the voluntary operations of the human mind </s>
<s> They dreaded the mysterious power of spells and incantations of potent herbs and execrable rites which could extinguish or recall life inflame the passions of the soul blast the works of creation and extort from the reluctant daemons the secrets of futurity </s>
<s> They believed with the wildest inconsistency that this preternatural dominion of the air of earth and of hell was exercised from the vilest motives of malice or gain by some wrinkled hags and itinerant sorcerers who passed their obscure lives in penury and contempt </s>

<s> The dark predictions of the death of an emperor or the success of a conspiracy were calculated only to stimulate the hopes of ambition and to dissolve the ties of fidelity and the intentional guilt of magic was aggravated by the actual crimes of treason and sacrilege </s>
<s> 49 Such vain terrors disturbed the peace of society and the happiness of individuals and the harmless flame which insensibly melted a waxen image might derive a powerful and pernicious energy from the affrighted fancy of the person whom it was maliciously designed to represent </s>

<s> 51 This deadly and incoherent mixture of treason and magic of poison and adultery afforded infinite gradations of guilt and innocence of excuse and aggravation which in these proceedings appear to have been confounded by the angry or corrupt passions of the judges </s>
<s> They easily discovered that the degree of their industry and discernment was estimated by the Imperial court according to the number of executions that were furnished from the respective tribunals </s>
<s> It was not without extreme reluctance that they pronounced a sentence of acquittal but they eagerly admitted such evidence as was stained with perjury or procured by torture to prove the most improbable charges against the most respectable characters </s>
<s> The progress of the inquiry continually opened new subjects of criminal prosecution the audacious informer whose falsehood was detected retired with impunity but the wretched victim who discovered his real or pretended accomplices were seldom permitted to receive the price of his infamy </s>

<s> 56 They urged with persuasive eloquence that in all cases of treason suspicion is equivalent to proof that the power supposes the intention of mischief that the intention is not less criminal than the act and that a subject no longer deserves to live if his life may threaten the safety or disturb the repose of his sovereign </s>

<s> They praised his inflexible love of justice and in the pursuit of justice the emperor was easily tempted to consider clemency as a weakness and passion as a virtue </s>

<s> The dispassionate judgment of the Western emperor could clearly perceive and accurately pursue his own and the public interest and the sovereign of the East who imitated with equal docility the various examples which he received from his elder brother was sometimes guided by the wisdom and virtue of the praefect Sallust </s>
<s> Both princes invariably retained in the purple the chaste and temperate simplicity which had adorned their private life and under their reign the pleasures of the court never cost the people a blush or a sigh </s>
<s> They gradually reformed many of the abuses of the times of Constantius judiciously adopted and improved the designs of Julian and his successor and displayed a style and spirit of legislation which might inspire posterity with the most favorable opinion of their character and government </s>
<s> It is not from the master of Innocence that we should expect the tender regard for the welfare of his subjects which prompted Valentinian to condemn the exposition of newborn infants 60 and to establish fourteen skilful physicians with stipends and privileges in the fourteen quarters of Rome </s>
<s> The good sense of an illiterate soldier founded a useful and liberal institution for the education of youth and the support of declining science </s>
<s> 61 It was his intention that the arts of rhetoric and grammar should be taught in the Greek and Latin languages in the metropolis of every province and as the size and dignity of the school was usually proportioned to the importance of the city the academies of Rome and Constantinople claimed a just and singular preeminence </s>
<s> The fragments of the literary edicts of Valentinian imperfectly represent the school of Constantinople which was gradually improved by subsequent regulations </s>
<s> That school consisted of thirtyone professors in different branches of learning </s>
<s> One philosopher and two lawyers five sophists and ten grammarians for the Greek and three orators and ten grammarians for the Latin tongue besides seven scribes or as they were then styled antiquarians whose laborious pens supplied the public library with fair and correct copies of the classic writers </s>
<s> The rule of conduct which was prescribed to the students is the more curious as it affords the first outlines of the form and discipline of a modern university </s>
<s> It was required that they should bring proper certificates from the magistrates of their native province </s>
<s> Their names professions and places of abode were regularly entered in a public register </s>
<s> The studious youth were severely prohibited from wasting their time in feasts or in the theatre and the term of their education was limited to the age of twenty </s>
<s> The praefect of the city was empowered to chastise the idle and refractory by stripes or expulsion and he was directed to make an annual report to the master of the offices that the knowledge and abilities of the scholars might be usefully applied to the public service </s>
<s> The institutions of Valentinian contributed to secure the benefits of peace and plenty and the cities were guarded by the establishment of the Defensors 62 freely elected as the tribunes and advocates of the people to support their rights and to expose their grievances before the tribunals of the civil magistrates or even at the foot of the Imperial throne </s>
<s> The finances were diligently administered by two princes who had been so long accustomed to the rigid economy of a private fortune but in the receipt and application of the revenue a discerning eye might observe some difference between the government of the East and of the West </s>
<s> Valens was persuaded that royal liberality can be supplied only by public oppression and his ambition never aspired to secure by their actual distress the future strength and prosperity of his people </s>
<s> Instead of increasing the weight of taxes which in the space of forty years had been gradually doubled he reduced in the first years of his reign one fourth of the tribute of the East </s>
<s> 63 Valentinian appears to have been less attentive and less anxious to relieve the burdens of his people </s>
<s> He might reform the abuses of the fiscal administration but he exacted without scruple a very large share of the private property as he was convinced that the revenues which supported the luxury of individuals would be much more advantageously employed for the defence and improvement of the state </s>

<s> The government of the Earth claimed his vigilance and satisfied his ambition and while he remembered that he was the disciple of the church he never forgot that he was the sovereign of the clergy </s>
<s> Under the reign of an apostate he had signalized his zeal for the honor of Christianity he allowed to his subjects the privilege which he had assumed for himself and they might accept with gratitude and confidence the general toleration which was granted by a prince addicted to passion but incapable of fear or of disguise </s>
<s> 65 The Pagans the Jews and all the various sects which acknowledged the divine authority of Christ were protected by the laws from arbitrary power or popular insult nor was any mode of worship prohibited by Valentinian except those secret and criminal practices which abused the name of religion for the dark purposes of vice and disorder </s>

<s> Philosophy alone can boast and perhaps it is no more than the boast of philosophy that her gentle hand is able to eradicate from the human mind the latent and deadly principle of fanaticism </s>

<s> As soon as the Christians of the West had extricated themselves from the snares of the creed of Rimini they happily relapsed into the slumber of orthodoxy and the small remains of the Arian party that still subsisted at Sirmium or Milan might be considered rather as objects of contempt than of resentment </s>
<s> But in the provinces of the East from the Euxine to the extremity of Thebais the strength and numbers of the hostile factions were more equally balanced and this equality instead of recommending the counsels of peace served only to perpetuate the horrors of religious war </s>
<s> The monks and bishops supported their arguments by invectives and their invectives were sometimes followed by blows </s>
<s> Athanasius still reigned at Alexandria the thrones of Constantinople and Antioch were occupied by Arian prelates and every episcopal vacancy was the occasion of a popular tumult </s>
<s> The Homoousians were fortified by the reconciliation of fiftynine Macelonian or SemiArian bishops but their secret reluctance to embrace the divinity of the Holy Ghost clouded the splendor of the triumph and the declaration of Valens who in the first years of his reign had imitated the impartial conduct of his brother was an important victory on the side of Arianism </s>
<s> The two brothers had passed their private life in the condition of catechumens but the piety of Valens prompted him to solicit the sacrament of baptism before he exposed his person to the dangers of a Gothic war </s>
<s> He naturally addressed himself to Eudoxus 66 bishop of the Imperial city and if the ignorant monarch was instructed by that Arian pastor in the principles of heterodox theology his misfortune rather than his guilt was the inevitable consequence of his erroneous choice </s>
<s> Whatever had been the determination of the emperor he must have offended a numerous party of his Christian subjects as the leaders both of the Homoousians and of the Arians believed that if they were not suffered to reign they were most cruelly injured and oppressed </s>
<s> After he had taken this decisive step it was extremely difficult for him to preserve either the virtue or the reputation of impartiality </s>
<s> He never aspired like Constantius to the fame of a profound theologian but as he had received with simplicity and respect the tenets of Euxodus Valens resigned his conscience to the direction of his ecclesiastical guides and promoted by the influence of his authority the reunion of the Athanasian heretics to the body of the Catholic church </s>
<s> At first he pitied their blindness by degrees he was provoked at their obstinacy and he insensibly hated those sectaries to whom he was an object of hatred </s>
<s> 67 The feeble mind of Valens was always swayed by the persons with whom he familiarly conversed and the exile or imprisonment of a private citizen are the favors the most readily granted in a despotic court </s>
<s> Such punishments were frequently inflicted on the leaders of the Homoousian party and the misfortune of fourscore ecclesiastics of Constantinople who perhaps accidentally were burned on shipboard was imputed to the cruel and premeditated malice of the emperor and his Arian ministers </s>
<s> In every contest the Catholics if we may anticipate that name were obliged to pay the penalty of their own faults and of those of their adversaries </s>
<s> In every election the claims of the Arian candidate obtained the preference and if they were opposed by the majority of the people he was usually supported by the authority of the civil magistrate or even by the terrors of a military force </s>
<s> The enemies of Athanasius attempted to disturb the last years of his venerable age and his temporary retreat to his father's sepulchre has been celebrated as a fifth exile </s>
<s> But the zeal of a great people who instantly flew to arms intimidated the praefect and the archbishop was permitted to end his life in peace and in glory after a reign of fortyseven years </s>
<s> The death of Athanasius was the signal of the persecution of Egypt and the Pagan minister of Valens who forcibly seated the worthless Lucius on the archiepiscopal throne purchased the favor of the reigning party by the blood and sufferings of their Christian brethren </s>

<s> 69 1 </s>
<s> The silence of Valentinian may suggest a probable argument that the partial severities which were exercised in the name and provinces of his colleague amounted only to some obscure and inconsiderable deviations from the established system of religious toleration and the judicious historian who has praised the equal temper of the elder brother has not thought himself obliged to contrast the tranquillity of the West with the cruel persecution of the East </s>
<s> 70 2 </s>
<s> Whatever credit may be allowed to vague and distant reports the character or at least the behavior of Valens may be most distinctly seen in his personal transactions with the eloquent Basil archbishop of Caesarea who had succeeded Athanasius in the management of the Trinitarian cause </s>
<s> 71 The circumstantial narrative has been composed by the friends and admirers of Basil and as soon as we have stripped away a thick coat of rhetoric and miracle we shall be astonished by the unexpected mildness of the Arian tyrant who admired the firmness of his character or was apprehensive if he employed violence of a general revolt in the province of Cappadocia </s>
<s> The archbishop who asserted with inflexible pride 72 the truth of his opinions and the dignity of his rank was left in the free possession of his conscience and his throne </s>

<s> 73 3 </s>
<s> I am not able to discover that any law such as Theodosius afterwards enacted against the Arians was published by Valens against the Athanasian sectaries and the edict which excited the most violent clamors may not appear so extremely reprehensible </s>
<s> The emperor had observed that several of his subjects gratifying their lazy disposition under the pretence of religion had associated themselves with the monks of Egypt and he directed the count of the East to drag them from their solitude and to compel these deserters of society to accept the fair alternative of renouncing their temporal possessions or of discharging the public duties of men and citizens </s>
<s> 74 The ministers of Valens seem to have extended the sense of this penal statute since they claimed a right of enlisting the young and ablebodied monks in the Imperial armies </s>

<s> p </s>
<s> 79 but what proves the truth of those miracles.] The strict regulations which have been framed by the wisdom of modern legislators to restrain the wealth and avarice of the clergy may be originally deduced from the example of the emperor Valentinian </s>
<s> His edict 77 addressed to Damasus bishop of Rome was publicly read in the churches of the city </s>
<s> He admonished the ecclesiastics and monks not to frequent the houses of widows and virgins and menaced their disobedience with the animadversion of the civil judge </s>
<s> The director was no longer permitted to receive any gift or legacy or inheritance from the liberality of his spiritualdaughter every testament contrary to this edict was declared null and void and the illegal donation was confiscated for the use of the treasury </s>
<s> By a subsequent regulation it should seem that the same provisions were extended to nuns and bishops and that all persons of the ecclesiastical order were rendered incapable of receiving any testamentary gifts and strictly confined to the natural and legal rights of inheritance </s>
<s> As the guardian of domestic happiness and virtue Valentinian applied this severe remedy to the growing evil </s>
<s> In the capital of the empire the females of noble and opulent houses possessed a very ample share of independent property and many of those devout females had embraced the doctrines of Christianity not only with the cold assent of the understanding but with the warmth of affection and perhaps with the eagerness of fashion </s>
<s> They sacrificed the pleasures of dress and luxury and renounced for the praise of chastity the soft endearments of conjugal society </s>
<s> Some ecclesiastic of real or apparent sanctity was chosen to direct their timorous conscience and to amuse the vacant tenderness of their heart and the unbounded confidence which they hastily bestowed was often abused by knaves and enthusiasts who hastened from the extremities of the East to enjoy on a splendid theatre the privileges of the monastic profession </s>
<s> By their contempt of the world they insensibly acquired its most desirable advantages the lively attachment perhaps of a young and beautiful woman the delicate plenty of an opulent household and the respectful homage of the slaves the freedmen and the clients of a senatorial family </s>
<s> The immense fortunes of the Roman ladies were gradually consumed in lavish alms and expensive pilgrimages and the artful monk who had assigned himself the first or possibly the sole place in the testament of his spiritual daughter still presumed to declare with the smooth face of hypocrisy that he was only the instrument of charity and the steward of the poor </s>
<s> The lucrative but disgraceful trade 78 which was exercised by the clergy to defraud the expectations of the natural heirs had provoked the indignation of a superstitious age and two of the most respectable of the Latin fathers very honestly confess that the ignominious edict of Valentinian was just and necessary and that the Christian priests had deserved to lose a privilege which was still enjoyed by comedians charioteers and the ministers of idols </s>
<s> But the wisdom and authority of the legislator are seldom victorious in a contest with the vigilant dexterity of private interest and Jerom or Ambrose might patiently acquiesce in the justice of an ineffectual or salutary law </s>
<s> If the ecclesiastics were checked in the pursuit of personal emolument they would exert a more laudable industry to increase the wealth of the church and dignify their covetousness with the specious names of piety and patriotism </s>

<s> 80 But the splendid vices of the church of Rome under the reign of Valentinian and Damasus have been curiously observed by the historian Ammianus who delivers his impartial sense in these expressive words The praefecture of Juventius was accompanied with peace and plenty but the tranquillity of his government was soon disturbed by a bloody sedition of the distracted people </s>
<s> The ardor of Damasus and Ursinus to seize the episcopal seat surpassed the ordinary measure of human ambition </s>
<s> They contended with the rage of party the quarrel was maintained by the wounds and death of their followers and the praefect unable to resist or appease the tumult was constrained by superior violence to retire into the suburbs </s>
<s> Damasus prevailed the welldisputed victory remained on the side of his faction one hundred and thirtyseven dead bodies 81 were found in the Basilica of Sicininus 82 where the Christians hold their religious assemblies and it was long before the angry minds of the people resumed their accustomed tranquillity </s>
<s> When I consider the splendor of the capital I am not astonished that so valuable a prize should inflame the desires of ambitious men and produce the fiercest and most obstinate contests </s>
<s> The successful candidate is secure that he will be enriched by the offerings of matrons 83 that as soon as his dress is composed with becoming care and elegance he may proceed in his chariot through the streets of Rome 84 and that the sumptuousness of the Imperial table will not equal the profuse and delicate entertainments provided by the taste and at the expense of the Roman pontiffs </s>
<s> How much more rationally continues the honest Pagan would those pontiffs consult their true happiness if instead of alleging the greatness of the city as an excuse for their manners they would imitate the exemplary life of some provincial bishops whose temperance and sobriety whose mean apparel and downcast looks recommend their pure and modest virtue to the Deity and his true worshippers </s>
<s> 85 The schism of Damasus and Ursinus was extinguished by the exile of the latter and the wisdom of the praefect Praetextatus 86 restored the tranquillity of the city </s>
<s> Praetextatus was a philosophic Pagan a man of learning of taste and politeness who disguised a reproach in the form of a jest when he assured Damasus that if he could obtain the bishopric of Rome he himself would immediately embrace the Christian religion </s>

<s> When the suffrage of the generals and of the army committed the sceptre of the Roman empire to the hands of Valentinian his reputation in arms his military skill and experience and his rigid attachment to the forms as well as spirit of ancient discipline were the principal motives of their judicious choice </s>
<s> The eagerness of the troops who pressed him to nominate his colleague was justified by the dangerous situation of public affairs and Valentinian himself was conscious that the abilities of the most active mind were unequal to the defence of the distant frontiers of an invaded monarchy </s>
<s> As soon as the death of Julian had relieved the Barbarians from the terror of his name the most sanguine hopes of rapine and conquest excited the nations of the East of the North and of the South </s>
<s> Their inroads were often vexatious and sometimes formidable but during the twelve years of the reign of Valentinian his firmness and vigilance protected his own dominions and his powerful genius seemed to inspire and direct the feeble counsels of his brother </s>

<s> The ambassadors of the Alemanni had been offended by the harsh and haughty behavior of Ursacius master of the offices 88 who by an act of unseasonable parsimony had diminished the value as well as the quantity of the presents to which they were entitled either from custom or treaty on the accession of a new emperor </s>
<s> They expressed and they communicated to their countrymen their strong sense of the national affront </s>
<s> The irascible minds of the chiefs were exasperated by the suspicion of contempt and the martial youth crowded to their standard </s>
<s> Before Valentinian could pass the Alps the villages of Gaul were in flames before his general Degalaiphus could encounter the Alemanni they had secured the captives and the spoil in the forests of Germany </s>
<s> In the beginning of the ensuing year the military force of the whole nation in deep and solid columns broke through the barrier of the Rhine during the severity of a northern winter </s>
<s> Two Roman counts were defeated and mortally wounded and the standard of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the Heruli and Batavians fell into the hands of the conquerors who displayed with insulting shouts and menaces the trophy of their victory </s>
<s> The standard was recovered but the Batavians had not redeemed the shame of their disgrace and flight in the eyes of their severe judge </s>
<s> It was the opinion of Valentinian that his soldiers must learn to fear their commander before they could cease to fear the enemy </s>
<s> The troops were solemnly assembled and the trembling Batavians were enclosed within the circle of the Imperial army </s>
<s> Valentinian then ascended his tribunal and as if he disdained to punish cowardice with death he inflicted a stain of indelible ignominy on the officers whose misconduct and pusillanimity were found to be the first occasion of the defeat </s>
<s> The Batavians were degraded from their rank stripped of their arms and condemned to be sold for slaves to the highest bidder </s>
<s> At this tremendous sentence the troops fell prostrate on the ground deprecated the indignation of their sovereign and protested that if he would indulge them in another trial they would approve themselves not unworthy of the name of Romans and of his soldiers </s>
<s> Valentinian with affected reluctance yielded to their entreaties the Batavians resumed their arms and with their arms the invincible resolution of wiping away their disgrace in the blood of the Alemanni </s>
<s> 89 The principal command was declined by Dagalaiphus and that experienced general who had represented perhaps with too much prudence the extreme difficulties of the undertaking had the mortification before the end of the campaign of seeing his rival Jovinus convert those difficulties into a decisive advantage over the scattered forces of the Barbarians </s>
<s> At the head of a welldisciplined army of cavalry infantry and light troops Jovinus advanced with cautious and rapid steps to Scarponna 90 in the territory of Metz where he surprised a large division of the Alemanni before they had time to run to their arms and flushed his soldiers with the confidence of an easy and bloodless victory </s>
<s> Another division or rather army of the enemy after the cruel and wanton devastation of the adjacent country reposed themselves on the shady banks of the Moselle </s>
<s> Jovinus who had viewed the ground with the eye of a general made a silent approach through a deep and woody vale till he could distinctly perceive the indolent security of the Germans </s>
<s> Some were bathing their huge limbs in the river others were combing their long and flaxen hair others again were swallowing large draughts of rich and delicious wine </s>
<s> On a sudden they heard the sound of the Roman trumpet they saw the enemy in their camp </s>
<s> Astonishment produced disorder disorder was followed by flight and dismay and the confused multitude of the bravest warriors was pierced by the swords and javelins of the legionaries and auxiliaries </s>
<s> The fugitives escaped to the third and most considerable camp in the Catalonian plains near Chalons in Champagne the straggling detachments were hastily recalled to their standard and the Barbarian chiefs alarmed and admonished by the fate of their companions prepared to encounter in a decisive battle the victorious forces of the lieutenant of Valentinian </s>
<s> The bloody and obstinate conflict lasted a whole summer's day with equal valor and with alternate success </s>
<s> The Romans at length prevailed with the loss of about twelve hundred men </s>
<s> Six thousand of the Alemanni were slain four thousand were wounded and the brave Jovinus after chasing the flying remnant of their host as far as the banks of the Rhine returned to Paris to receive the applause of his sovereign and the ensigns of the consulship for the ensuing year </s>
<s> 91 The triumph of the Romans was indeed sullied by their treatment of the captive king whom they hung on a gibbet without the knowledge of their indignant general </s>
<s> This disgraceful act of cruelty which might be imputed to the fury of the troops was followed by the deliberate murder of Withicab the son of Vadomair a German prince of a weak and sickly constitution but of a daring and formidable spirit </s>
<s> The domestic assassin was instigated and protected by the Romans 92 and the violation of the laws of humanity and justice betrayed their secret apprehension of the weakness of the declining empire </s>

<s> ! Every step which they gained increased their ardor and abated the resistance of the enemy and after their united forces had occupied the summit of the hill they impetuously urged the Barbarians down the northern descent where Count Sebastian was posted to intercept their retreat </s>

<s> The younger Victor mentions the mechanical genius of Valentinian nova arma meditari fingere terra seu limo simulacra.] That prudent emperor who diligently practised the wise maxims of Diocletian was studious to foment and excite the intestine divisions of the tribes of Germany </s>
<s> About the middle of the fourth century the countries perhaps of Lusace and Thuringia on either side of the Elbe were occupied by the vague dominion of the Burgundians a warlike and numerous people of the Vandal race 96 whose obscure name insensibly swelled into a powerful kingdom and has finally settled on a flourishing province </s>
<s> The most remarkable circumstance in the ancient manners of the Burgundians appears to have been the difference of their civil and ecclesiastical constitution </s>
<s> The appellation of Hendinos was given to the king or general and the title of Sinistus to the high priest of the nation </s>
<s> The person of the priest was sacred and his dignity perpetual but the temporal government was held by a very precarious tenure </s>
<s> If the events of war accuses the courage or conduct of the king he was immediately deposed and the injustice of his subjects made him responsible for the fertility of the earth and the regularity of the seasons which seemed to fall more properly within the sacerdotal department </s>
<s> 97 The disputed possession of some saltpits 98 engaged the Alemanni and the Burgundians in frequent contests the latter were easily tempted by the secret solicitations and liberal offers of the emperor and their fabulous descent from the Roman soldiers who had formerly been left to garrison the fortresses of Drusus was admitted with mutual credulity as it was conducive to mutual interest </s>
<s> 99 An army of fourscore thousand Burgundians soon appeared on the banks of the Rhine and impatiently required the support and subsidies which Valentinian had promised but they were amused with excuses and delays till at length after a fruitless expectation they were compelled to retire </s>
<s> The arms and fortifications of the Gallic frontier checked the fury of their just resentment and their massacre of the captives served to imbitter the hereditary feud of the Burgundians and the Alemanni </s>
<s> The inconstancy of a wise prince may perhaps be explained by some alteration of circumstances and perhaps it was the original design of Valentinian to intimidate rather than to destroy as the balance of power would have been equally overturned by the extirpation of either of the German nations </s>
<s> Among the princes of the Alemanni Macrianus who with a Roman name had assumed the arts of a soldier and a statesman deserved his hatred and esteem </s>

<s> 32 and the Chronicles of Jerom and Cassiodorus fix some dates and add some circumstances.] The land was covered by the fortifications of Valentinian but the seacoast of Gaul and Britain was exposed to the depredations of the Saxons </s>
<s> That celebrated name in which we have a dear and domestic interest escaped the notice of Tacitus and in the maps of Ptolemy it faintly marks the narrow neck of the Cimbric peninsula and three small islands towards the mouth of the Elbe </s>
<s> 101 This contracted territory the present duchy of Sleswig or perhaps of Holstein was incapable of pouring forth the inexhaustible swarms of Saxons who reigned over the ocean who filled the British island with their language their laws and their colonies and who so long defended the liberty of the North against the arms of Charlemagne </s>
<s> 102 The solution of this difficulty is easily derived from the similar manners and loose constitution of the tribes of Germany which were blended with each other by the slightest accidents of war or friendship </s>
<s> The situation of the native Saxons disposed them to embrace the hazardous professions of fishermen and pirates and the success of their first adventures would naturally excite the emulation of their bravest countrymen who were impatient of the gloomy solitude of their woods and mountains </s>
<s> Every tide might float down the Elbe whole fleets of canoes filled with hardy and intrepid associates who aspired to behold the unbounded prospect of the ocean and to taste the wealth and luxury of unknown worlds </s>
<s> It should seem probable however that the most numerous auxiliaries of the Saxons were furnished by the nations who dwelt along the shores of the Baltic </s>
<s> They possessed arms and ships the art of navigation and the habits of naval war but the difficulty of issuing through the northern columns of Hercules 103 which during several months of the year are obstructed with ice confined their skill and courage within the limits of a spacious lake </s>
<s> The rumor of the successful armaments which sailed from the mouth of the Elbe would soon provoke them to cross the narrow isthmus of Sleswig and to launch their vessels on the great sea </s>
<s> The various troops of pirates and adventurers who fought under the same standard were insensibly united in a permanent society at first of rapine and afterwards of government </s>
<s> A military confederation was gradually moulded into a national body by the gentle operation of marriage and consanguinity and the adjacent tribes who solicited the alliance accepted the name and laws of the Saxons </s>
<s> If the fact were not established by the most unquestionable evidence we should appear to abuse the credulity of our readers by the description of the vessels in which the Saxon pirates ventured to sport in the waves of the German Ocean the British Channel and the Bay of Biscay </s>
<s> The keel of their large flat bottomed boats were framed of light timber but the sides and upper works consisted only of wicker with a covering of strong hides </s>
<s> 104 In the course of their slow and distant navigations they must always have been exposed to the danger and very frequently to the misfortune of shipwreck and the naval annals of the Saxons were undoubtedly filled with the accounts of the losses which they sustained on the coasts of Britain and Gaul </s>
<s> But the daring spirit of the pirates braved the perils both of the sea and of the shore their skill was confirmed by the habits of enterprise the meanest of their mariners was alike capable of handling an oar of rearing a sail or of conducting a vessel and the Saxons rejoiced in the appearance of a tempest which concealed their design and dispersed the fleets of the enemy </s>
<s> 105 After they had acquired an accurate knowledge of the maritime provinces of the West they extended the scene of their depredations and the most sequestered places had no reason to presume on their security </s>
<s> The Saxon boats drew so little water that they could easily proceed fourscore or a hundred miles up the great rivers their weight was so inconsiderable that they were transported on wagons from one river to another and the pirates who had entered the mouth of the Seine or of the Rhine might descend with the rapid stream of the Rhone into the Mediterranean </s>
<s> Under the reign of Valentinian the maritime provinces of Gaul were afflicted by the Saxons a military count was stationed for the defence of the seacoast or Armorican limit and that officer who found his strength or his abilities unequal to the task implored the assistance of Severus mastergeneral of the infantry </s>
<s> The Saxons surrounded and outnumbered were forced to relinquish their spoil and to yield a select band of their tall and robust youth to serve in the Imperial armies </s>
<s> They stipulated only a safe and honorable retreat and the condition was readily granted by the Roman general who meditated an act of perfidy 106 imprudent as it was inhuman while a Saxon remained alive and in arms to revenge the fate of their countrymen </s>
<s> The premature eagerness of the infantry who were secretly posted in a deep valley betrayed the ambuscade and they would perhaps have fallen the victims of their own treachery if a large body of cuirassiers alarmed by the noise of the combat had not hastily advanced to extricate their companions and to overwhelm the undaunted valor of the Saxons </s>
<s> Some of the prisoners were saved from the edge of the sword to shed their blood in the amphitheatre and the orator Symmachus complains that twentynine of those desperate savages by strangling themselves with their own hands had disappointed the amusement of the public </s>

<s> The cultivation of the earth might introduce a more accurate separation of property and the habits of a sedentary life but the love of arms and rapine was still the ruling passion of the Picts and their warriors who stripped themselves for a day of battle were distinguished in the eyes of the Romans by the strange fashion of painting their naked bodies with gaudy colors and fantastic figures </s>
<s> The western part of Caledonia irregularly rises into wild and barren hills which scarcely repay the toil of the husbandman and are most profitably used for the pasture of cattle </s>
<s> The highlanders were condemned to the occupations of shepherds and hunters and as they seldom were fixed to any permanent habitation they acquired the expressive name of Scots which in the Celtic tongue is said to be equivalent to that of wanderers or vagrants </s>
<s> The inhabitants of a barren land were urged to seek a fresh supply of food in the waters </s>
<s> The deep lakes and bays which intersect their country are plentifully supplied with fish and they gradually ventured to cast their nets in the waves of the ocean </s>

<s> It is probable that in some remote period of antiquity the fertile plains of Ulster received a colony of hungry Scots and that the strangers of the North who had dared to encounter the arms of the legions spread their conquests over the savage and unwarlike natives of a solitary island </s>

<s> 122 He was received as the deliverer of his country and as soon as it appeared that Romanus was formidable only to a submissive province the tyrant of Africa became the object of universal contempt </s>

<s> The ignominious treaty which saved the army of Jovian had been faithfully executed on the side of the Romans and as they had solemnly renounced the sovereignty and alliance of Armenia and Iberia those tributary kingdoms were exposed without protection to the arms of the Persian monarch </s>
<s> 133 Sapor entered the Armenian territories at the head of a formidable host of cuirassiers of archers and of mercenary foot but it was the invariable practice of Sapor to mix war and negotiation and to consider falsehood and perjury as the most powerful instruments of regal policy </s>
<s> He affected to praise the prudent and moderate conduct of the king of Armenia and the unsuspicious Tiranus was persuaded by the repeated assurances of insidious friendship to deliver his person into the hands of a faithless and cruel enemy </s>
<s> In the midst of a splendid entertainment he was bound in chains of silver as an honor due to the blood of the Arsacides and after a short confinement in the Tower of Oblivion at Ecbatana he was released from the miseries of life either by his own dagger or by that of an assassin </s>
<s> The kingdom of Armenia was reduced to the state of a Persian province the administration was shared between a distinguished satrap and a favorite eunuch and Sapor marched without delay to subdue the martial spirit of the Iberians </s>
<s> Sauromaces who reigned in that country by the permission of the emperors was expelled by a superior force and as an insult on the majesty of Rome the king of kings placed a diadem on the head of his abject vassal Aspacuras </s>
<s> The city of Artogerassa 134 was the only place of Armenia ! </s>
<s> which presumed to resist the efforts of his arms </s>
<s> The treasure deposited in that strong fortress tempted the avarice of Sapor but the danger of Olympias the wife or widow of the Armenian king excited the public compassion and animated the desperate valor of her subjects and soldiers </s>
<s> !! </s>
<s> The Persians were surprised and repulsed under the walls of Artogerassa by a bold and wellconcerted sally of the besieged </s>
<s> But the forces of Sapor were continually renewed and increased the hopeless courage of the garrison was exhausted the strength of the walls yielded to the assault and the proud conqueror after wasting the rebellious city with fire and sword led away captive an unfortunate queen who in a more auspicious hour had been the destined bride of the son of Constantine </s>
<s> 135 Yet if Sapor already triumphed in the easy conquest of two dependent kingdoms he soon felt that a country is unsubdued as long as the minds of the people are actuated by a hostile and contumacious spirit </s>
<s> The satraps whom he was obliged to trust embraced the first opportunity of regaining the affection of their countrymen and of signalizing their immortal hatred to the Persian name </s>
<s> Since the conversion of the Armenians and Iberians these nations considered the Christians as the favorites and the Magians as the adversaries of the Supreme Being the influence of the clergy over a superstitious people was uniformly exerted in the cause of Rome and as long as the successors of Constantine disputed with those of Artaxerxes the sovereignty of the intermediate provinces the religious connection always threw a decisive advantage into the scale of the empire </s>
<s> A numerous and active party acknowledged Para the son of Tiranus as the lawful sovereign of Armenia and his title to the throne was deeply rooted in the hereditary succession of five hundred years </s>
<s> By the unanimous consent of the Iberians the country was equally divided between the rival princes and Aspacuras who owed his diadem to the choice of Sapor was obliged to declare that his regard for his children who were detained as hostages by the tyrant was the only consideration which prevented him from openly renouncing the alliance of Persia </s>
<s> The emperor Valens who respected the obligations of the treaty and who was apprehensive of involving the East in a dangerous war ventured with slow and cautious measures to support the Roman party in the kingdoms of Iberia and Armenia </s>
<s> !!! </s>
<s> Twelve legions established the authority of Sauromaces on the banks of the Cyrus </s>
<s> The Euphrates was protected by the valor of Arintheus </s>
<s> A powerful army under the command of Count Trajan and of Vadomair king of the Alemanni fixed their camp on the confines of Armenia </s>
<s> But they were strictly enjoined not to commit the first hostilities which might be understood as a breach of the treaty and such was the implicit obedience of the Roman general that they retreated with exemplary patience under a shower of Persian arrows till they had clearly acquired a just title to an honorable and legitimate victory </s>
<s> Yet these appearances of war insensibly subsided in a vain and tedious negotiation </s>
<s> The contending parties supported their claims by mutual reproaches of perfidy and ambition and it should seem that the original treaty was expressed in very obscure terms since they were reduced to the necessity of making their inconclusive appeal to the partial testimony of the generals of the two nations who had assisted at the negotiations </s>
<s> 136 The invasion of the Goths and Huns which soon afterwards shook the foundations of the Roman empire exposed the provinces of Asia to the arms of Sapor </s>
<s> But the declining age and perhaps the infirmities of the monarch suggested new maxims of tranquillity and moderation </s>
<s> His death which happened in the full maturity of a reign of seventy years changed in a moment the court and councils of Persia and their attention was most probably engaged by domestic troubles and the distant efforts of a Carmanian war </s>
<s> 137 The remembrance of ancient injuries was lost in the enjoyment of peace </s>
<s> The kingdoms of Armenia and Iberia were permitted by the mutualthough tacit consent of both empires to resume their doubtful neutrality </s>

<s> The individuals of the same tribe are constantly assembled but they are assembled in a camp and the native spirit of these dauntless shepherds is animated by mutual support and emulation </s>

<s> 620 664.] Chapter XXVI Progress of The Huns </s>
<s> Part II </s>
<s> The Huns who under the reign of Valens threatened the empire of Rome had been formidable in a much earlier period to the empire of China </s>
<s> 27 Their ancient perhaps their original seat was an extensive though dry and barren tract of country immediately on the north side of the great wall </s>
<s> Their place is at present occupied by the fortynine Hords or Banners of the Mongous a pastoral nation which consists of about two hundred thousand families </s>
<s> 28 But the valor of the Huns had extended the narrow limits of their dominions and their rustic chiefs who assumed the appellation of Tanjou gradually became the conquerors and the sovereigns of a formidable empire </s>
<s> Towards the East their victorious arms were stopped only by the ocean and the tribes which are thinly scattered between the Amoor and the extreme peninsula of Corea adhered with reluctance to the standard of the Huns </s>
<s> On the West near the head of the Irtish in the valleys of Imaus they found a more ample space and more numerous enemies </s>
<s> One of the lieutenants of the Tanjou subdued in a single expedition twentysix nations the Igours 29 distinguished above the Tartar race by the use of letters were in the number of his vassals and by the strange connection of human events the flight of one of those vagrant tribes recalled the victorious Parthians from the invasion of Syria </s>
<s> 30 On the side of the North the ocean was assigned as the limit of the power of the Huns </s>
<s> Without enemies to resist their progress or witnesses to contradict their vanity they might securely achieve a real or imaginary conquest of the frozen regions of Siberia </s>
<s> The Northren Sea was fixed as the remote boundary of their empire </s>
<s> But the name of that sea on whose shores the patriot Sovou embraced the life of a shepherd and an exile 31 may be transferred with much more probability to the Baikal a capacious basin above three hundred miles in length which disdains the modest appellation of a lake 32 and which actually communicates with the seas of the North by the long course of the Angara the Tongusha and the Jenissea </s>
<s> The submission of so many distant nations might flatter the pride of the Tanjou but the valor of the Huns could be rewarded only by the enjoyment of the wealth and luxury of the empire of the South </s>
<s> In the third century ! before the Christian aera a wall of fifteen hundred miles in length was constructed to defend the frontiers of China against the inroads of the Huns 33 but this stupendous work which holds a conspicuous place in the map of the world has never contributed to the safety of an unwarlike people </s>
<s> The cavalry of the Tanjou frequently consisted of two or three hundred thousand men formidable by the matchless dexterity with which they managed their bows and their horses by their hardy patience in supporting the inclemency of the weather and by the incredible speed of their march which was seldom checked by torrents or precipices by the deepest rivers or by the most lofty mountains </s>
<s> They spread themselves at once over the face of the country and their rapid impetuosity surprised astonished and disconcerted the grave and elaborate tactics of a Chinese army </s>
<s> The emperor Kaoti 34 a soldier of fortune whose personal merit had raised him to the throne marched against the Huns with those veteran troops which had been trained in the civil wars of China </s>
<s> But he was soon surrounded by the Barbarians and after a siege of seven days the monarch hopeless of relief was reduced to purchase his deliverance by an ignominious capitulation </s>
<s> The successors of Kaoti whose lives were dedicated to the arts of peace or the luxury of the palace submitted to a more permanent disgrace </s>
<s> They too hastily confessed the insufficiency of arms and fortifications </s>
<s> They were too easily convinced that while the blazing signals announced on every side the approach of the Huns the Chinese troops who slept with the helmet on their head and the cuirass on their back were destroyed by the incessant labor of ineffectual marches </s>
<s> 35 A regular payment of money and silk was stipulated as the condition of a temporary and precarious peace and the wretched expedient of disguising a real tribute under the names of a gift or subsidy was practised by the emperors of China as well as by those of Rome </s>
<s> But there still remained a more disgraceful article of tribute which violated the sacred feelings of humanity and nature </s>
<s> The hardships of the savage life which destroy in their infancy the children who are born with a less healthy and robust constitution introduced a remarkable disproportion between the numbers of the two sexes </s>
<s> The Tartars are an ugly and even deformed race and while they consider their own women as the instruments of domestic labor their desires or rather their appetites are directed to the enjoyment of more elegant beauty </s>
<s> A select band of the fairest maidens of China was annually devoted to the rude embraces of the Huns 36 and the alliance of the haughty Tanjous was secured by their marriage with the genuine or adopted daughters of the Imperial family which vainly attempted to escape the sacrilegious pollution </s>
<s> The situation of these unhappy victims is described in the verses of a Chinese princess who laments that she had been condemned by her parents to a distant exile under a Barbarian husband who complains that sour milk was her only drink raw flesh her only food a tent her only palace and who expresses in a strain of pathetic simplicity the natural wish that she were transformed into a bird to fly back to her dear country the object of her tender and perpetual regret </s>

<s> 62.] The conquest of China has been twice achieved by the pastoral tribes of the North the forces of the Huns were not inferior to those of the Moguls or of the Mantcheoux and their ambition might entertain the most sanguine hopes of success </s>
<s> But their pride was humbled and their progress was checked by the arms and policy of Vouti 38 the fifth emperor of the powerful dynasty of the Han </s>
<s> In his long reign of fiftyfour years the Barbarians of the southern provinces submitted to the laws and manners of China and the ancient limits of the monarchy were enlarged from the great river of Kiang to the port of Canton </s>
<s> Instead of confining himself to the timid operations of a defensive war his lieutenants penetrated many hundred miles into the country of the Huns </s>
<s> In those boundless deserts where it is impossible to form magazines and difficult to transport a sufficient supply of provisions the armies of Vouti were repeatedly exposed to intolerable hardships and of one hundred and forty thousand soldiers who marched against the Barbarians thirty thousand only returned in safety to the feet of their master </s>
<s> These losses however were compensated by splendid and decisive success </s>
<s> The Chinese generals improved the superiority which they derived from the temper of their arms their chariots of war and the service of their Tartar auxiliaries </s>
<s> The camp of the Tanjou was surprised in the midst of sleep and intemperance and though the monarch of the Huns bravely cut his way through the ranks of the enemy he left above fifteen thousand of his subjects on the field of battle </s>
<s> Yet this signal victory which was preceded and followed by many bloody engagements contributed much less to the destruction of the power of the Huns than the effectual policy which was employed to detach the tributary nations from their obedience </s>
<s> Intimidated by the arms or allured by the promises of Vouti and his successors the most considerable tribes both of the East and of the West disclaimed the authority of the Tanjou </s>
<s> While some acknowledged themselves the allies or vassals of the empire they all became the implacable enemies of the Huns and the numbers of that haughty people as soon as they were reduced to their native strength might perhaps have been contained within the walls of one of the great and populous cities of China </s>
<s> 39 The desertion of his subjects and the perplexity of a civil war at length compelled the Tanjou himself to renounce the dignity of an independent sovereign and the freedom of a warlike and highspirited nation </s>
<s> He was received at Sigan the capital of the monarchy by the troops the mandarins and the emperor himself with all the honors that could adorn and disguise the triumph of Chinese vanity </s>
<s> 40 A magnificent palace was prepared for his reception his place was assigned above all the princes of the royal family and the patience of the Barbarian king was exhausted by the ceremonies of a banquet which consisted of eight courses of meat and of nine solemn pieces of music </s>
<s> But he performed on his knees the duty of a respectful homage to the emperor of China pronounced in his own name and in the name of his successors a perpetual oath of fidelity and gratefully accepted a seal which was bestowed as the emblem of his regal dependence </s>
<s> After this humiliating submission the Tanjous sometimes departed from their allegiance and seized the favorable moments of war and rapine but the monarchy of the Huns gradually declined till it was broken by civil dissension into two hostile and separate kingdoms </s>
<s> One of the princes of the nation was urged by fear and ambition to retire towards the South with eight hords which composed between forty and fifty thousand families </s>
<s> He obtained with the title of Tanjou a convenient territory on the verge of the Chinese provinces and his constant attachment to the service of the empire was secured by weakness and the desire of revenge </s>
<s> From the time of this fatal schism the Huns of the North continued to languish about fifty years till they were oppressed on every side by their foreign and domestic enemies </s>
<s> The proud inscription 41 of a column erected on a lofty mountain announced to posterity that a Chinese army had marched seven hundred miles into the heart of their country </s>

<s> 44 Above one hundred thousand persons the poorest indeed and the most pusillanimous of the people were contented to remain in their native country to renounce their peculiar name and origin and to mingle with the victorious nation of the Sienpi </s>
<s> Fiftyeight hords about two hundred thousand men ambitious of a more honorable servitude retired towards the South implored the protection of the emperors of China and were permitted to inhabit and to guard the extreme frontiers of the province of Chansi and the territory of Ortous </s>
<s> But the most warlike and powerful tribes of the Huns maintained in their adverse fortune the undaunted spirit of their ancestors </s>
<s> The Western world was open to their valor and they resolved under the conduct of their hereditary chieftains to conquer and subdue some remote country which was still inaccessible to the arms of the Sienpi and to the laws of China </s>
<s> 45 The course of their emigration soon carried them beyond the mountains of Imaus and the limits of the Chinese geography but we are able to distinguish the two great divisions of these formidable exiles which directed their march towards the Oxus and towards the Volga </s>
<s> The first of these colonies established their dominion in the fruitful and extensive plains of Sogdiana on the eastern side of the Caspian where they preserved the name of Huns with the epithet of Euthalites or Nepthalites </s>
<s> Their manners were softened and even their features were insensibly improved by the mildness of the climate and their long residence in a flourishing province 46 which might still retain a faint impression of the arts of Greece </s>
<s> 47 The white Huns a name which they derived from the change of their complexions soon abandoned the pastoral life of Scythia </s>
<s> Gorgo which under the appellation of Carizme has since enjoyed a temporary splendor was the residence of the king who exercised a legal authority over an obedient people </s>
<s> Their luxury was maintained by the labor of the Sogdians and the only vestige of their ancient barbarism was the custom which obliged all the companions perhaps to the number of twenty who had shared the liberality of a wealthy lord to be buried alive in the same grave </s>
<s> 48 The vicinity of the Huns to the provinces of Persia involved them in frequent and bloody contests with the power of that monarchy </s>
<s> But they respected in peace the faith of treaties in war she dictates of humanity and their memorable victory over Peroses or Firuz displayed the moderation as well as the valor of the Barbarians </s>
<s> The second division of their countrymen the Huns who gradually advanced towards the Northwest were exercised by the hardships of a colder climate and a more laborious march </s>
<s> Necessity compelled them to exchange the silks of China for the furs of Siberia the imperfect rudiments of civilized life were obliterated and the native fierceness of the Huns was exasperated by their intercourse with the savage tribes who were compared with some propriety to the wild beasts of the desert </s>
<s> Their independent spirit soon rejected the hereditary succession of the Tanjous and while each horde was governed by its peculiar mursa their tumultuary council directed the public measures of the whole nation </s>
<s> As late as the thirteenth century their transient residence on the eastern banks of the Volga was attested by the name of Great Hungary </s>
<s> 49 In the winter they descended with their flocks and herds towards the mouth of that mighty river and their summer excursions reached as high as the latitude of Saratoff or perhaps the conflux of the Kama </s>
<s> Such at least were the recent limits of the black Calmucks 50 who remained about a century under the protection of Russia and who have since returned to their native seats on the frontiers of the Chinese empire </s>
<s> The march and the return of those wandering Tartars whose united camp consists of fifty thousand tents or families illustrate the distant emigrations of the ancient Huns </s>

<s> The emperor affects the smooth and specious language of the Son of Heaven and the Father of his People.] It is impossible to fill the dark interval of time which elapsed after the Huns of the Volga were lost in the eyes of the Chinese and before they showed themselves to those of the Romans </s>
<s> There is some reason however to apprehend that the same force which had driven them from their native seats still continued to impel their march towards the frontiers of Europe </s>
<s> The power of the Sienpi their implacable enemies which extended above three thousand miles from East to West 52 must have gradually oppressed them by the weight and terror of a formidable neighborhood and the flight of the tribes of Scythia would inevitably tend to increase the strength or to contract the territories of the Huns </s>
<s> The harsh and obscure appellations of those tribes would offend the ear without informing the understanding of the reader but I cannot suppress the very natural suspicion that the Huns of the North derived a considerable reenforcement from the ruin of the dynasty of the South which in the course of the third century submitted to the dominion of China that the bravest warriors marched away in search of their free and adventurous countrymen and that as they had been divided by prosperity they were easily reunited by the common hardships of their adverse fortune </s>
<s> 53 The Huns with their flocks and herds their wives and children their dependents and allies were transported to the west of the Volga and they boldly advanced to invade the country of the Alani a pastoral people who occupied or wasted an extensive tract of the deserts of Scythia </s>

<s> The mixture of Samartic and German blood had contributed to improve the features of the Alani to whiten their swarthy complexions and to tinge their hair with a yellowish cast which is seldom found in the Tartar race </s>
<s> They were less deformed in their persons less brutish in their manners than the Huns but they did not yield to those formidable Barbarians in their martial and independent spirit in the love of freedom which rejected even the use of domestic slaves and in the love of arms which considered war and rapine as the pleasure and the glory of mankind </s>
<s> A naked cimeter fixed in the ground was the only object of their religious worship the scalps of their enemies formed the costly trappings of their horses and they viewed with pity and contempt the pusillanimous warriors who patiently expected the infirmities of age and the tortures of lingering disease </s>
<s> 54 On the banks of the Tanais the military power of the Huns and the Alani encountered each other with equal valor but with unequal success </s>
<s> The Huns prevailed in the bloody contest the king of the Alani was slain and the remains of the vanquished nation were dispersed by the ordinary alternative of flight or submission </s>
<s> 55 A colony of exiles found a secure refuge in the mountains of Caucasus between the Euxine and the Caspian where they still preserve their name and their independence </s>
<s> Another colony advanced with more intrepid courage towards the shores of the Baltic associated themselves with the Northern tribes of Germany and shared the spoil of the Roman provinces of Gaul and Spain </s>

<s> The numbers the strength the rapid motions and the implacable cruelty of the Huns were felt and dreaded and magnified by the astonished Goths who beheld their fields and villages consumed with flames and deluged with indiscriminate slaughter </s>

<s> After Valens had terminated the Gothic war with some appearance of glory and success he made a progress through his dominions of Asia and at length fixed his residence in the capital of Syria </s>
<s> The five years 63 which he spent at Antioch was employed to watch from a secure distance the hostile designs of the Persian monarch to check the depredations of the Saracens and Isaurians 64 to enforce by arguments more prevalent than those of reason and eloquence the belief of the Arian theology and to satisfy his anxious suspicions by the promiscuous execution of the innocent and the guilty </s>
<s> But the attention of the emperor was most seriously engaged by the important intelligence which he received from the civil and military officers who were intrusted with the defence of the Danube </s>
<s> He was informed that the North was agitated by a furious tempest that the irruption of the Huns an unknown and monstrous race of savages had subverted the power of the Goths and that the suppliant multitudes of that warlike nation whose pride was now humbled in the dust covered a space of many miles along the banks of the river </s>
<s> With outstretched arms and pathetic lamentations they loudly deplored their past misfortunes and their present danger acknowledged that their only hope of safety was in the clemency of the Roman government and most solemnly protested that if the gracious liberality of the emperor would permit them to cultivate the waste lands of Thrace they should ever hold themselves bound by the strongest obligations of duty and gratitude to obey the laws and to guard the limits of the republic </s>
<s> These assurances were confirmed by the ambassadors of the Goths who impatiently expected from the mouth of Valens an answer that must finally determine the fate of their unhappy countrymen </s>
<s> The emperor of the East was no longer guided by the wisdom and authority of his elder brother whose death happened towards the end of the preceding year and as the distressful situation of the Goths required an instant and peremptory decision he was deprived of the favorite resources of feeble and timid minds who consider the use of dilatory and ambiguous measures as the most admirable efforts of consummate prudence </s>
<s> As long as the same passions and interests subsist among mankind the questions of war and peace of justice and policy which were debated in the councils of antiquity will frequently present themselves as the subject of modern deliberation </s>
<s> But the most experienced statesman of Europe has never been summoned to consider the propriety or the danger of admitting or rejecting an innumerable multitude of Barbarians who are driven by despair and hunger to solicit a settlement on the territories of a civilized nation </s>
<s> When that important proposition so essentially connected with the public safety was referred to the ministers of Valens they were perplexed and divided but they soon acquiesced in the flattering sentiment which seemed the most favorable to the pride the indolence and the avarice of their sovereign </s>
<s> The slaves who were decorated with the titles of praefects and generals dissembled or disregarded the terrors of this national emigration so extremely different from the partial and accidental colonies which had been received on the extreme limits of the empire </s>
<s> But they applauded the liberality of fortune which had conducted from the most distant countries of the globe a numerous and invincible army of strangers to defend the throne of Valens who might now add to the royal treasures the immense sums of gold supplied by the provincials to compensate their annual proportion of recruits </s>
<s> The prayers of the Goths were granted and their service was accepted by the Imperial court and orders were immediately despatched to the civil and military governors of the Thracian diocese to make the necessary preparations for the passage and subsistence of a great people till a proper and sufficient territory could be allotted for their future residence </s>
<s> The liberality of the emperor was accompanied however with two harsh and rigorous conditions which prudence might justify on the side of the Romans but which distress alone could extort from the indignant Goths </s>
<s> Before they passed the Danube they were required to deliver their arms and it was insisted that their children should be taken from them and dispersed through the provinces of Asia where they might be civilized by the arts of education and serve as hostages to secure the fidelity of their parents </s>

<s> It was thought expedient that an accurate account should be taken of their numbers but the persons who were employed soon desisted with amazement and dismay from the prosecution of the endless and impracticable task 67 and the principal historian of the age most seriously affirms that the prodigious armies of Darius and Xerxes which had so long been considered as the fables of vain and credulous antiquity were now justified in the eyes of mankind by the evidence of fact and experience </s>
<s> A probable testimony has fixed the number of the Gothic warriors at two hundred thousand men and if we can venture to add the just proportion of women of children and of slaves the whole mass of people which composed this formidable emigration must have amounted to near a million of persons of both sexes and of all ages </s>

<s> The most lively resentment is excited by the tyranny of pretended benefactors who sternly exact the debt of gratitude which they have cancelled by subsequent injuries a spirit of discontent insensibly arose in the camp of the Barbarians who pleaded without success the merit of their patient and dutiful behavior and loudly complained of the inhospitable treatment which they had received from their new allies </s>

<s> One of the most dangerous inconveniences of the introduction of the Barbarians into the army and the palace was sensibly felt in their correspondence with their hostile countrymen to whom they imprudently or maliciously revealed the weakness of the Roman empire </s>

<s> Every forest and every village poured forth a band of hardy adventurers and the great army of the Alemanni which on their approach was estimated at forty thousand men by the fears of the people was afterwards magnified to the number of seventy thousand by the vain and credulous flattery of the Imperial court </s>
<s> The legions which had been ordered to march into Pannonia were immediately recalled or detained for the defence of Gaul the military command was divided between Nanienus and Mellobaudes and the youthful emperor though he respected the long experience and sober wisdom of the former was much more inclined to admire and to follow the martial ardor of his colleague who was allowed to unite the incompatible characters of count of the domestics and of king of the Franks </s>

<s> After this signal victory which secured the peace of Gaul and asserted the honor of the Roman arms the emperor Gratian appeared to proceed without delay on his Eastern expedition but as he approached the confines of the Alemanni he suddenly inclined to the left surprised them by his unexpected passage of the Rhine and boldly advanced into the heart of their country </s>
<s> The Barbarians opposed to his progress the obstacles of nature and of courage and still continued to retreat from one hill to another till they were satisfied by repeated trials of the power and perseverance of their enemies </s>
<s> Their submission was accepted as a proof not indeed of their sincere repentance but of their actual distress and a select number of their brave and robust youth was exacted from the faithless nation as the most substantial pledge of their future moderation </s>

<s> Before he had reposed himself ten days in the capital he was urged by the licentious clamors of the Hippodrome to march against the Barbarians whom he had invited into his dominions and the citizens who are always brave at a distance from any real danger declared with confidence that if they were supplied with arms they alone would undertake to deliver the province from the ravages of an insulting foe </s>
<s> 88 The vain reproaches of an ignorant multitude hastened the downfall of the Roman empire they provoked the desperate rashness of Valens who did not find either in his reputation or in his mind any motives to support with firmness the public contempt </s>
<s> He was soon persuaded by the successful achievements of his lieutenants to despise the power of the Goths who by the diligence of Fritigern were now collected in the neighborhood of Hadrianople </s>
<s> The march of the Taifalae had been intercepted by the valiant Frigeric the king of those licentious Barbarians was slain in battle and the suppliant captives were sent into distant exile to cultivate the lands of Italy which were assigned for their settlement in the vacant territories of Modena and Parma </s>

<s> The splendid narratives which the general transmitted of his own exploits alarmed the Imperial court by the appearance of superior merit and though he cautiously insisted on the difficulties of the Gothic war his valor was praised his advice was rejected and Valens who listened with pride and pleasure to the flattering suggestions of the eunuchs of the palace was impatient to seize the glory of an easy and assured conquest </s>
<s> His army was strengthened by a numerous reenforcement of veterans and his march from Constantinople to Hadrianople was conducted with so much military skill that he prevented the activity of the Barbarians who designed to occupy the intermediate defiles and to intercept either the troops themselves or their convoys of provisions </s>
<s> The camp of Valens which he pitched under the walls of Hadrianople was fortified according to the practice of the Romans with a ditch and rampart and a most important council was summoned to decide the fate of the emperor and of the empire </s>

<s> The ruin of Valens was precipitated by the deceitful arts of Fritigern and the prudent admonitions of the emperor of the West </s>
<s> The advantages of negotiating in the midst of war were perfectly understood by the general of the Barbarians and a Christian ecclesiastic was despatched as the holy minister of peace to penetrate and to perplex the councils of the enemy </s>
<s> The misfortunes as well as the provocations of the Gothic nation were forcibly and truly described by their ambassador who protested in the name of Fritigern that he was still disposed to lay down his arms or to employ them only in the defence of the empire if he could secure for his wandering countrymen a tranquil settlement on the waste lands of Thrace and a sufficient allowance of corn and cattle </s>
<s> But he added in a whisper of confidential friendship that the exasperated Barbarians were averse to these reasonable conditions and that Fritigern was doubtful whether he could accomplish the conclusion of the treaty unless he found himself supported by the presence and terrors of an Imperial army </s>
<s> About the same time Count Richomer returned from the West to announce the defeat and submission of the Alemanni to inform Valens that his nephew advanced by rapid marches at the head of the veteran and victorious legions of Gaul and to request in the name of Gratian and of the republic that every dangerous and decisive measure might be suspended till the junction of the two emperors should insure the success of the Gothic war </s>
<s> But the feeble sovereign of the East was actuated only by the fatal illusions of pride and jealousy </s>
<s> He disdained the importunate advice he rejected the humiliating aid he secretly compared the ignominious at least the inglorious period of his own reign with the fame of a beardless youth and Valens rushed into the field to erect his imaginary trophy before the diligence of his colleague could usurp any share of the triumphs of the day </s>

<s> Whatever may have been the just measure of the calamities of Europe there was reason to fear that the same calamities would soon extend to the peaceful countries of Asia </s>

<s> In the space of about twelve years their numbers had continually increased and the children who in the first emigration were sent over the Hellespont had attained with rapid growth the strength and spirit of perfect manhood </s>
<s> 102 It was impossible to conceal from their knowledge the events of the Gothic war and as those daring youths had not studied the language of dissimulation they betrayed their wish their desire perhaps their intention to emulate the glorious example of their fathers The danger of the times seemed to justify the jealous suspicions of the provincials and these suspicions were admitted as unquestionable evidence that the Goths of Asia had formed a secret and dangerous conspiracy against the public safety </s>
<s> The death of Valens had left the East without a sovereign and Julius who filled the important station of mastergeneral of the troops with a high reputation of diligence and ability thought it his duty to consult the senate of Constantinople which he considered during the vacancy of the throne as the representative council of the nation </s>
<s> As soon as he had obtained the discretionary power of acting as he should judge most expedient for the good of the republic he assembled the principal officers and privately concerted effectual measures for the execution of his bloody design </s>
<s> An order was immediately promulgated that on a stated day the Gothic youth should assemble in the capital cities of their respective provinces and as a report was industriously circulated that they were summoned to receive a liberal gift of lands and money the pleasing hope allayed the fury of their resentment and perhaps suspended the motions of the conspiracy </s>
<s> On the appointed day the unarmed crowd of the Gothic youth was carefully collected in the square or Forum the streets and avenues were occupied by the Roman troops and the roofs of the houses were covered with archers and slingers </s>
<s> At the same hour in all the cities of the East the signal was given of indiscriminate slaughter and the provinces of Asia were delivered by the cruel prudence of Julius from a domestic enemy who in a few months might have carried fire and sword from the Hellespont to the Euphrates </s>

<s> Whatever resentment the rash and jealous vanity of his uncle might deserve the resentment of a generous mind is easily subdued by the softer emotions of grief and compassion and even the sense of pity was soon lost in the serious and alarming consideration of the state of the republic </s>
<s> Gratian was too late to assist he was too weak to revenge his unfortunate colleague and the valiant and modest youth felt himself unequal to the support of a sinking world </s>
<s> A formidable tempest of the Barbarians of Germany seemed ready to burst over the provinces of Gaul and the mind of Gratian was oppressed and distracted by the administration of the Western empire </s>
<s> In this important crisis the government of the East and the conduct of the Gothic war required the undivided attention of a hero and a statesman </s>
<s> A subject invested with such ample command would not long have preserved his fidelity to a distant benefactor and the Imperial council embraced the wise and manly resolution of conferring an obligation rather than of yielding to an insult </s>
<s> It was the wish of Gratian to bestow the purple as the reward of virtue but at the age of nineteen it is not easy for a prince educated in the supreme rank to understand the true characters of his ministers and generals </s>
<s> He attempted to weigh with an impartial hand their various merits and defects and whilst he checked the rash confidence of ambition he distrusted the cautious wisdom which despaired of the republic </s>
<s> As each moment of delay diminished something of the power and resources of the future sovereign of the East the situation of the times would not allow a tedious debate </s>
<s> The choice of Gratian was soon declared in favor of an exile whose father only three years before had suffered under the sanction of his authority an unjust and ignominious death </s>

<s> His time was almost equally divided between the town and country the spirit which had animated his public conduct was shown in the active and affectionate performance of every social duty and the diligence of the soldier was profitably converted to the improvement of his ample patrimony 111 which lay between Valladolid and Segovia in the midst of a fruitful district still famous for a most exquisite breed of sheep </s>
<s> 112 From the innocent but humble labors of his farm Theodosius was transported in less than four months to the throne of the Eastern empire and the whole period of the history of the world will not perhaps afford a similar example of an elevation at the same time so pure and so honorable </s>

<s> Even in those governments which allow the reigning monarch to declare a colleague or a successor his partial choice which may be influenced by the blindest passions is often directed to an unworthy object But the most suspicious malignity cannot ascribe to Theodosius in his obscure solitude of Caucha the arts the desires or even the hopes of an ambitious statesman and the name of the Exile would long since have been forgotten if his genuine and distinguished virtues had not left a deep impression in the Imperial court </s>

<s> Ammianus Marcellinus who terminates his useful work with the defeat and death of Valens recommends the more glorious subject of the ensuing reign to the youthful vigor and eloquence of the rising generation </s>
<s> 113 The rising generation was not disposed to accept his advice or to imitate his example 114 and in the study of the reign of Theodosius we are reduced to illustrate the partial narrative of Zosimus by the obscure hints of fragments and chronicles by the figurative style of poetry or panegyric and by the precarious assistance of the ecclesiastical writers who in the heat of religious faction are apt to despise the profane virtues of sincerity and moderation </s>
<s> Conscious of these disadvantages which will continue to involve a considerable portion of the decline and fall of the Roman empire I shall proceed with doubtful and timorous steps </s>
<s> Yet I may boldly pronounce that the battle of Hadrianople was never revenged by any signal or decisive victory of Theodosius over the Barbarians and the expressive silence of his venal orators may be confirmed by the observation of the condition and circumstances of the times </s>
<s> The fabric of a mighty state which has been reared by the labors of successive ages could not be overturned by the misfortune of a single day if the fatal power of the imagination did not exaggerate the real measure of the calamity </s>
<s> The loss of forty thousand Romans who fell in the plains of Hadrianople might have been soon recruited in the populous provinces of the East which contained so many millions of inhabitants </s>
<s> The courage of a soldier is found to be the cheapest and most common quality of human nature and sufficient skill to encounter an undisciplined foe might have been speedily taught by the care of the surviving centurions </s>
<s> If the Barbarians were mounted on the horses and equipped with the armor of their vanquished enemies the numerous studs of Cappadocia and Spain would have supplied new squadrons of cavalry the thirtyfour arsenals of the empire were plentifully stored with magazines of offensive and defensive arms and the wealth of Asia might still have yielded an ample fund for the expenses of the war </s>
<s> But the effects which were produced by the battle of Hadrianople on the minds of the Barbarians and of the Romans extended the victory of the former and the defeat of the latter far beyond the limits of a single day </s>
<s> A Gothic chief was heard to declare with insolent moderation that for his own part he was fatigued with slaughter but that he was astonished how a people who fled before him like a flock of sheep could still presume to dispute the possession of their treasures and provinces </s>
<s> 115 The same terrors which the name of the Huns had spread among the Gothic tribes were inspired by the formidable name of the Goths among the subjects and soldiers of the Roman empire </s>
<s> 116 If Theodosius hastily collecting his scattered forces had led them into the field to encounter a victorious enemy his army would have been vanquished by their own fears and his rashness could not have been excused by the chance of success </s>
<s> But the great Theodosius an epithet which he honorably deserved on this momentous occasion conducted himself as the firm and faithful guardian of the republic </s>
<s> He fixed his headquarters at Thessalonica the capital of the Macedonian diocese 117 from whence he could watch the irregular motions of the Barbarians and direct the operations of his lieutenants from the gates of Constantinople to the shores of the Hadriatic </s>
<s> The fortifications and garrisons of the cities were strengthened and the troops among whom a sense of order and discipline was revived were insensibly emboldened by the confidence of their own safety </s>
<s> From these secure stations they were encouraged to make frequent sallies on the Barbarians who infested the adjacent country and as they were seldom allowed to engage without some decisive superiority either of ground or of numbers their enterprises were for the most part successful and they were soon convinced by their own experience of the possibility of vanquishing their invincible enemies </s>
<s> The detachments of these separate garrisons were generally united into small armies the same cautious measures were pursued according to an extensive and wellconcerted plan of operations the events of each day added strength and spirit to the Roman arms and the artful diligence of the emperor who circulated the most favorable reports of the success of the war contributed to subdue the pride of the Barbarians and to animate the hopes and courage of his subjects </s>
<s> If instead of this faint and imperfect outline we could accurately represent the counsels and actions of Theodosius in four successive campaigns there is reason to believe that his consummate skill would deserve the applause of every military reader </s>
<s> The republic had formerly been saved by the delays of Fabius and while the splendid trophies of Scipio in the field of Zama attract the eyes of posterity the camps and marches of the dictator among the hills of the Campania may claim a juster proportion of the solid and independent fame which the general is not compelled to share either with fortune or with his troops </s>
<s> Such was likewise the merit of Theodosius and the infirmities of his body which most unseasonably languished under a long and dangerous disease could not oppress the vigor of his mind or divert his attention from the public service </s>

<s> A spirit of discord arose among the independent tribes and nations which had been united only by the bands of a loose and voluntary alliance </s>
<s> The troops of the Huns and the Alani would naturally upbraid the flight of the Goths who were not disposed to use with moderation the advantages of their fortune the ancient jealousy of the Ostrogoths and the Visigoths could not long be suspended and the haughty chiefs still remembered the insults and injuries which they had reciprocally offered or sustained while the nation was seated in the countries beyond the Danube </s>
<s> The progress of domestic faction abated the more diffusive sentiment of national animosity and the officers of Theodosius were instructed to purchase with liberal gifts and promises the retreat or service of the discontented party </s>
<s> The acquisition of Modar a prince of the royal blood of the Amali gave a bold and faithful champion to the cause of Rome </s>
<s> The illustrious deserter soon obtained the rank of mastergeneral with an important command surprised an army of his countrymen who were immersed in wine and sleep and after a cruel slaughter of the astonished Goths returned with an immense spoil and four thousand wagons to the Imperial camp </s>
<s> 120 In the hands of a skilful politician the most different means may be successfully applied to the same ends and the peace of the empire which had been forwarded by the divisions was accomplished by the reunion of the Gothic nation </s>
<s> Athanaric who had been a patient spectator of these extraordinary events was at length driven by the chance of arms from the dark recesses of the woods of Caucaland </s>
<s> He no longer hesitated to pass the Danube and a very considerable part of the subjects of Fritigern who already felt the inconveniences of anarchy were easily persuaded to acknowledge for their king a Gothic Judge whose birth they respected and whose abilities they had frequently experienced </s>
<s> But age had chilled the daring spirit of Athanaric and instead of leading his people to the field of battle and victory he wisely listened to the fair proposal of an honorable and advantageous treaty </s>
<s> Theodosius who was acquainted with the merit and power of his new ally condescended to meet him at the distance of several miles from Constantinople and entertained him in the Imperial city with the confidence of a friend and the magnificence of a monarch </s>
<s> The Barbarian prince observed with curious attention the variety of objects which attracted his notice and at last broke out into a sincere and passionate exclamation of wonder </s>
<s> I now behold said he what I never could believe the glories of this stupendous capital </s>
<s> And as he cast his eyes around he viewed and he admired the commanding situation of the city the strength and beauty of the walls and public edifices the capacious harbor crowded with innumerable vessels the perpetual concourse of distant nations and the arms and discipline of the troops </s>

<s> While they struggled to force their way in the unequal conflict their right flank was overwhelmed by the irresistible attack of a fleet of galleys which were urged down the stream by the united impulse of oars and of the tide </s>
<s> The weight and velocity of those ships of war broke and sunk and dispersed the rude and feeble canoes of the Barbarians their valor was ineffectual and Alatheus the king or general of the Ostrogoths perished with his bravest troops either by the sword of the Romans or in the waves of the Danube </s>
<s> The last division of this unfortunate fleet might regain the opposite shore but the distress and disorder of the multitude rendered them alike incapable either of action or counsel and they soon implored the clemency of the victorious enemy </s>

<s> The partial and malignant historian who misrepresents every action of his reign affirms that the emperor did not appear in the field of battle till the Barbarians had been vanquished by the valor and conduct of his lieutenant Promotus </s>
<s> 126 The flattering poet who celebrated in the court of Honorius the glory of the father and of the son ascribes the victory to the personal prowess of Theodosius and almost insinuates that the king of the Ostrogoths was slain by the hand of the emperor </s>

<s> A numerous colony of the Visigoths was seated in Thrace the remains of the Ostrogoths were planted in Phrygia and Lydia their immediate wants were supplied by a distribution of corn and cattle and their future industry was encouraged by an exemption from tribute during a certain term of years </s>

<s> They required and they obtained the sole possession of the villages and districts assigned for their residence they still cherished and propagated their native manners and language asserted in the bosom of despotism the freedom of their domestic government and acknowledged the sovereignty of the emperor without submitting to the inferior jurisdiction of the laws and magistrates of Rome </s>
<s> The hereditary chiefs of the tribes and families were still permitted to command their followers in peace and war but the royal dignity was abolished and the generals of the Goths were appointed and removed at the pleasure of the emperor </s>
<s> An army of forty thousand Goths was maintained for the perpetual service of the empire of the East and those haughty troops who assumed the title of Foederati or allies were distinguished by their gold collars liberal pay and licentious privileges </s>
<s> Their native courage was improved by the use of arms and the knowledge of discipline and while the republic was guarded or threatened by the doubtful sword of the Barbarians the last sparks of the military flame were finally extinguished in the minds of the Romans </s>
<s> 129 Theodosius had the address to persuade his allies that the conditions of peace which had been extorted from him by prudence and necessity were the voluntary expressions of his sincere friendship for the Gothic nation </s>
<s> 130 A different mode of vindication or apology was opposed to the complaints of the people who loudly censured these shameful and dangerous concessions </s>
<s> 131 The calamities of the war were painted in the most lively colors and the first symptoms of the return of order of plenty and security were diligently exaggerated </s>
<s> The advocates of Theodosius could affirm with some appearance of truth and reason that it was impossible to extirpate so many warlike tribes who were rendered desperate by the loss of their native country and that the exhausted provinces would be revived by a fresh supply of soldiers and husbandmen </s>
<s> The Barbarians still wore an angry and hostile aspect but the experience of past times might encourage the hope that they would acquire the habits of industry and obedience that their manners would be polished by time education and the influence of Christianity and that their posterity would insensibly blend with the great body of the Roman people </s>

<s> Their rude and insolent behavior expressed their contempt of the citizens and provincials whom they insulted with impunity </s>

<s> But as the minds of the Barbarians were not insensible to the power of gratitude several of the Gothic leaders sincerely devoted themselves to the service of the empire or at least of the emperor the whole nation was insensibly divided into two opposite factions and much sophistry was employed in conversation and dispute to compare the obligations of their first and second engagements </s>
<s> The Goths who considered themselves as the friends of peace of justice and of Rome were directed by the authority of Fravitta a valiant and honorable youth distinguished above the rest of his countrymen by the politeness of his manners the liberality of his sentiments and the mild virtues of social life </s>
<s> But the more numerous faction adhered to the fierce and faithless Priulf who inflamed the passions and asserted the independence of his warlike followers </s>
<s> On one of the solemn festivals when the chiefs of both parties were invited to the Imperial table they were insensibly heated by wine till they forgot the usual restraints of discretion and respect and betrayed in the presence of Theodosius the fatal secret of their domestic disputes </s>
