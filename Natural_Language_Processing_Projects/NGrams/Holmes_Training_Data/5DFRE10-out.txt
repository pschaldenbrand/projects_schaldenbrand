<s> 2037 in his TableTalk.] The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews and their enmity to the Greeks </s>
<s> The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all representations of the Deity and that precept was firmly established in the principles and practice of the chosen people </s>
<s> The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the foolish idolaters who bowed before the workmanship of their own hands the images of brass and marble which had they been endowed with sense and motion should have started rather from the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist </s>
<s> 2 Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe might crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras 3 but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and spiritual and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the censure of the council of Illiberis three hundred years after the Christian aera </s>
<s> Under the successors of Constantine in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition for the benefit of the multitude and after the ruin of Paganism they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel </s>
<s> The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the veneration of the cross and of relics </s>
<s> The saints and martyrs whose intercession was implored were seated on the right hand if God but the gracious and often supernatural favors which in the popular belief were showered round their tomb conveyed an unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims who visited and touched and kissed these lifeless remains the memorials of their merits and sufferings </s>
<s> 4 But a memorial more interesting than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy is the faithful copy of his person and features delineated by the arts of painting or sculpture </s>
<s> In every age such copies so congenial to human feelings have been cherished by the zeal of private friendship or public esteem the images of the Roman emperors were adored with civil and almost religious honors a reverence less ostentatious but more sincere was applied to the statues of sages and patriots and these profane virtues these splendid sins disappeared in the presence of the holy men who had died for their celestial and everlasting country </s>
<s> At first the experiment was made with caution and scruple and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant to awaken the cold and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes </s>
<s> By a slow though inevitable progression the honors of the original were transferred to the copy the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint and the Pagan rites of genuflection luminaries and incense again stole into the Catholic church </s>
<s> The scruples of reason or piety were silenced by the strong evidence of visions and miracles and the pictures which speak and move and bleed must be endowed with a divine energy and may be considered as the proper objects of religious adoration </s>
<s> The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash attempt of defining by forms and colors the infinite Spirit the eternal Father who pervades and sustains the universe </s>
<s> 5 But the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to worship the angels and above all the Son of God under the human shape which on earth they have condescended to assume </s>
<s> The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and mortal body but that body had ascended into heaven and had not some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples the spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the visible relics and representations of the saints </s>
<s> A similar indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary the place of her burial was unknown and the assumption of her soul and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks and Latins </s>
<s> The use and even the worship of images was firmly established before the end of the sixth century they were fondly cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics the Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new superstition but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the West </s>
<s> The bolder forms of sculpture in brass or marble which peopled the temples of antiquity were offensive to the fancy or conscience of the Christian Greeks and a smooth surface of colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of imitation </s>

<s> 42.] The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the original but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God his mother and his apostles the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine 7 was more probably that of some temporal savior the Gnostics and their profane monuments were reprobated and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model </s>
<s> In this distress a bold and dexterous invention assured at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the worship </s>
<s> A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular basis of a Syrian legend on the correspondence of Christ and Abgarus so famous in the days of Eusebius so reluctantly deserted by our modern advocates </s>
<s> The bishop of Caesarea 8 records the epistle 9 but he most strangely forgets the picture of Christ 10 the perfect impression of his face on a linen with which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had invoked his healing power and offered the strong city of Edessa to protect him against the malice of the Jews </s>
<s> The ignorance of the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the image in a niche of the wall from whence after an oblivion of five hundred years it was released by some prudent bishop and seasonably presented to the devotion of the times </s>
<s> Its first and most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the arms of Chosroes Nushirvan and it was soon revered as a pledge of the divine promise that Edessa should never be taken by a foreign enemy </s>
<s> It is true indeed that the text of Procopius ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valor of her citizens who purchased the absence and repelled the assaults of the Persian monarch </s>
<s> He was ignorant the profane historian of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius that the Palladium was exposed on the rampart and that the water which had been sprinkled on the holy face instead of quenching added new fuel to the flames of the besieged </s>
<s> After this important service the image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude and if the Armenians rejected the legend the more credulous Greeks adored the similitude which was not the work of any mortal pencil but the immediate creation of the divine original </s>
<s> The style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry </s>
<s> How can we with mortal eyes contemplate this image whose celestial splendor the host of heaven presumes not to behold </s>
<s> He who dwells in heaven condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image He who is seated on the cherubim visits us this day by a picture which the Father has delineated with his immaculate hand which he has formed in an ineffable manner and which we sanctify by adoring it with fear and love </s>
<s> Before the end of the sixth century these images made without hands in Greek it is a single word 11 were propagated in the camps and cities of the Eastern empire 12 they were the objects of worship and the instruments of miracles and in the hour of danger or tumult their venerable presence could revive the hope rekindle the courage or repress the fury of the Roman legions </s>
<s> Of these pictures the far greater part the transcripts of a human pencil could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper title but there were some of higher descent who derived their resemblance from an immediate contact with the original endowed for that purpose with a miraculous and prolific virtue </s>
<s> The most ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the image of Edessa and such is the veronica of Rome or Spain or Jerusalem which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to his face and delivered to a holy matron </s>
<s> The fruitful precedent was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary and the saints and martyrs </s>
<s> In the church of Diospolis in Palestine the features of the Mother of God 13 were deeply inscribed in a marble column the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke and the Evangelist who was perhaps a physician has been forced to exercise the occupation of a painter so profane and odious in the eyes of the primitive Christians </s>
<s> The Olympian Jove created by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion but these Catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius </s>
<s> 14 [Footnote 7 After removing some rubbish of miracle and inconsistency it may be allowed that as late as the year 300 Paneas in Palestine was decorated with a bronze statue representing a grave personage wrapped in a cloak with a grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him and that an inscription was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal </s>

<s> It was thus that the ignorance and bigotry of a Greek priest applauded the pictures of Titian which he had ordered and refused to accept.] The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible degrees and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind as productive of comfort and innocent of sin </s>
<s> But in the beginning of the eighth century in the full magnitude of the abuse the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension that under the mask of Christianity they had restored the religion of their fathers they heard with grief and impatience the name of idolaters the incessant charge of the Jews and Mahometans 15 who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative worship </s>
<s> The servitude of the Jews might curb their zeal and depreciate their authority but the triumphant Mussulmans who reigned at Damascus and threatened Constantinople cast into the scale of reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory </s>
<s> The cities of Syria Palestine and Egypt had been fortified with the images of Christ his mother and his saints and each city presumed on the hope or promise of miraculous defence </s>
<s> In a rapid conquest of ten years the Arabs subdued those cities and these images and in their opinion the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and inanimate idols </s>
<s> For a while Edessa had braved the Persian assaults but the chosen city the spouse of Christ was involved in the common ruin and his divine resemblance became the slave and trophy of the infidels </s>
<s> After a servitude of three hundred years the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of Constantinople for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans and a perpetual truce for the territory of Edessa </s>
<s> 16 In this season of distress and dismay the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence of images and they attempted to prove that the sin and schism of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor and annihilated the virtue of these precious symbols </s>
<s> But they were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational Christians who appealed to the evidence of texts of facts and of the primitive times and secretly desired the reformation of the church </s>
<s> As the worship of images had never been established by any general or positive law its progress in the Eastern empire had been retarded or accelerated by the differences of men and manners the local degrees of refinement and the personal characters of the bishops </s>
<s> The splendid devotion was fondly cherished by the levity of the capital and the inventive genius of the Byzantine clergy while the rude and remote districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred luxury </s>
<s> Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians maintained after their conversion the simple worship which had preceded their separation and the Armenians the most warlike subjects of Rome were not reconciled in the twelfth century to the sight of images </s>

<s> 148 but surely the superstitious Greek is unjust to the superstition of the Germans of the xiith century.] Of such adventurers the most fortunate was the emperor Leo the Third 18 who from the mountains of Isauria ascended the throne of the East </s>
<s> He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters but his education his reason perhaps his intercourse with the Jews and Arabs had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of images and it was held to be the duty of a prince to impose on his subjects the dictates of his own conscience </s>
<s> But in the outset of an unsettled reign during ten years of toil and danger Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy bowed before the idols which he despised and satisfied the Roman pontiff with the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal </s>
<s> In the reformation of religion his first steps were moderate and cautious he assembled a great council of senators and bishops and enacted with their consent that all the images should be removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the churches where they might be visible to the eyes and inaccessible to the superstition of the people </s>
<s> But it was impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse impulse of veneration and abhorrence in their lofty position the sacred images still edified their votaries and reproached the tyrant </s>
<s> He was himself provoked by resistance and invective and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his duty and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple </s>
<s> By a second edict he proscribed the existence as well as the use of religious pictures the churches of Constantinople and the provinces were cleansed from idolatry the images of Christ the Virgin and the saints were demolished or a smooth surface of plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice </s>
<s> The sect of the Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despotism of six emperors and the East and West were involved in a noisy conflict of one hundred and twenty years </s>
<s> It was the design of Leo the Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of faith and by the authority of a general council but the convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son Constantine 19 and though it is stigmatized by triumphant bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists their own partial and mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety </s>
<s> The debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of Constantinople and was composed of the respectable number of three hundred and thirtyeight bishops of Europe and Anatolia for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of the caliph and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks </s>
<s> This Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh general council yet even this title was a recognition of the six preceding assemblies which had laboriously built the structure of the Catholic faith </s>
<s> After a serious deliberation of six months the three hundred and thirtyeight bishops pronounced and subscribed a unanimous decree that all visible symbols of Christ except in the Eucharist were either blasphemous or heretical that imageworship was a corruption of Christianity and a renewal of Paganism that all such monuments of idolatry should be broken or erased and that those who should refuse to deliver the objects of their private superstition were guilty of disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor </s>
<s> In their loud and loyal acclamations they celebrated the merits of their temporal redeemer and to his zeal and justice they intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures </s>
<s> At Constantinople as in the former councils the will of the prince was the rule of episcopal faith but on this occasion I am inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and fear </s>
<s> In the long night of superstition the Christians had wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel nor was it easy for them to discern the clew and tread back the mazes of the labyrinth </s>
<s> The worship of images was inseparably blended at least to a pious fancy with the Cross the Virgin the Saints and their relics the holy ground was involved in a cloud of miracles and visions and the nerves of the mind curiosity and scepticism were benumbed by the habits of obedience and belief </s>
<s> Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal license to doubt or deny or deride the mysteries of the Catholics 20 but they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his bishops and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret horror the monuments of popular devotion which were consecrated to the honor of his celestial patrons </s>
<s> In the reformation of the sixteenth century freedom and knowledge had expanded all the faculties of man the thirst of innovation superseded the reverence of antiquity and the vigor of Europe could disdain those phantoms which terrified the sickly and servile weakness of the Greeks </s>

<s> How deplorable is the change </s>
<s> how tremendous the scandal </s>
<s> You now accuse the Catholics of idolatry and by the accusation you betray your own impiety and ignorance </s>

<s> After this decent salutation the pope attempts the usual distinction between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images </s>
<s> The former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any visible likeness </s>
<s> The latter are the genuine forms of Christ his mother and his saints who had approved by a crowd of miracles the innocence and merit of this relative worship </s>
<s> He must indeed have trusted to the ignorance of Leo since he could assert the perpetual use of images from the apostolic age and their venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church </s>
<s> A more specious argument is drawn from present possession and recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the demand of a general council and Gregory frankly confesses than such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox prince </s>
<s> To the impudent and inhuman Leo more guilty than a heretic he recommends peace silence and implicit obedience to his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome </s>
<s> The limits of civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff </s>
<s> To the former he appropriates the body to the latter the soul the sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate the more formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will not spare his offending father the successor of St. Peter may lawfully chastise the kings of the earth </s>

<s> Incapable as you are of defending your Roman subjects the maritime situation of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can remove to the distance of fourandtwenty stadia to the first fortress of the Lombards and then you may pursue the winds </s>

<s> But on the reception of his proscriptive edict they trembled for their domestic deities the images of Christ and the Virgin of the angels martyrs and saints were abolished in all the churches of Italy and a strong alternative was proposed to the Roman pontiff the royal favor as the price of his compliance degradation and exile as the penalty of his disobedience </s>
<s> Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the powers of resistance </s>
<s> Without depending on prayers or miracles he boldly armed against the public enemy and his pastoral letters admonished the Italians of their danger and their duty </s>
<s> 37 At this signal Ravenna Venice and the cities of the Exarchate and Pentapolis adhered to the cause of religion their military force by sea and land consisted for the most part of the natives and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused into the mercenary strangers </s>
<s> The Italians swore to live and die in the defence of the pope and the holy images the Roman people was devoted to their father and even the Lombards were ambitious to share the merit and advantage of this holy war </s>
<s> The most treasonable act but the most obvious revenge was the destruction of the statues of Leo himself the most effectual and pleasing measure of rebellion was the withholding the tribute of Italy and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused by the imposition of a new capitation </s>
<s> 38 A form of administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and governors and so high was the public indignation that the Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor and to conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of Constantinople </s>
<s> In that palace the Roman bishops the second and third Gregory were condemned as the authors of the revolt and every attempt was made either by fraud or force to seize their persons and to strike at their lives </s>
<s> The city was repeatedly visited or assaulted by captains of the guards and dukes and exarchs of high dignity or secret trust they landed with foreign troops they obtained some domestic aid and the superstition of Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of heresy </s>
<s> But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by the courage and vigilance of the Romans the Greeks were overthrown and massacred their leaders suffered an ignominious death and the popes however inclined to mercy refused to intercede for these guilty victims </s>
<s> At Ravenna 39 the several quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary feud in religious controversy they found a new aliment of faction but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or spirit and the exarch who attempted to stem the torrent lost his life in a popular sedition </s>
<s> To punish this flagitious deed and restore his dominion in Italy the emperor sent a fleet and army into the Adriatic Gulf </s>
<s> After suffering from the winds and waves much loss and delay the Greeks made their descent in the neighborhood of Ravenna they threatened to depopulate the guilty capital and to imitate perhaps to surpass the example of Justinian the Second who had chastised a former rebellion by the choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants </s>
<s> The women and clergy in sackcloth and ashes lay prostrate in prayer the men were in arms for the defence of their country the common danger had united the factions and the event of a battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege </s>
<s> In a hardfought day as the two armies alternately yielded and advanced a phantom was seen a voice was heard and Ravenna was victorious by the assurance of victory </s>
<s> The strangers retreated to their ships but the populous seacoast poured forth a multitude of boats the waters of the Po were so deeply infected with blood that during six years the public prejudice abstained from the fish of the river and the institution of an annual feast perpetuated the worship of images and the abhorrence of the Greek tyrant </s>
<s> Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms the Roman pontiff convened a synod of ninetythree bishops against the heresy of the Iconoclasts </s>
<s> With their consent he pronounced a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved 40 but the vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head </s>
<s> No sooner had they confirmed their own safety the worship of images and the freedom of Rome and Italy than the popes appear to have relaxed of their severity and to have spared the relics of the Byzantine dominion </s>
<s> Their moderate councils delayed and prevented the election of a new emperor and they exhorted the Italians not to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy </s>

<s> In the conquest of Italy the champions of the Roman church obtained a favorable occasion a specious title the wishes of the people the prayers and intrigues of the clergy </s>
<s> But the most essential gifts of the popes to the Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France 55 and of patrician of Rome </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St. Peter the nations began to resume the practice of seeking on the banks of the Tyber their kings their laws and the oracles of their fate </s>
<s> The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of their government </s>
<s> All the powers of royalty were exercised by Pepin mayor of the palace and nothing except the regal title was wanting to his ambition </s>
<s> His enemies were crushed by his valor his friends were multiplied by his liberality his father had been the savior of Christendom and the claims of personal merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four generations </s>
<s> The name and image of royalty was still preserved in the last descendant of Clovis the feeble Childeric but his obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the constitution and Pepin a subject and a prince was ambitious to ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family </s>
<s> The mayor and the nobles were bound by an oath of fidelity to the royal phantom the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff to dispel their scruples or to absolve their promise </s>
<s> The interest of Pope Zachary the successor of the two Gregories prompted him to decide and to decide in their favor he pronounced that the nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and authority of king and that the unfortunate Childeric a victim of the public safety should be degraded shaved and confined in a monastery for the remainder of his days </s>
<s> An answer so agreeable to their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a casuist the sentence of a judge or the oracle of a prophet the Merovingian race disappeared from the earth and Pepin was exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people accustomed to obey his laws and to march under his standard </s>
<s> His coronation was twice performed with the sanction of the popes by their most faithful servant St. Boniface the apostle of Germany and by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third who in the monastery of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor </s>
<s> The royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously applied 56 the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a divine ambassador a German chieftain was transformed into the Lord's anointed and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe </s>
<s> The Franks were absolved from their ancient oath but a dire anathema was thundered against them and their posterity if they should dare to renew the same freedom of choice or to elect a king except in the holy and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes </s>
<s> Without apprehending the future danger these princes gloried in their present security the secretary of Charlemagne affirms that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of the popes 57 and in their boldest enterprises they insist with confidence on this signal and successful act of temporal jurisdiction </s>

<s> Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of the Exarchate the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice of their independence </s>
<s> Yet even in this act they exercised the right of disposing of themselves and the decrees of the senate and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity with the honors of patrician of Rome </s>
<s> The leaders of a powerful nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate office but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended and in the vacancy of the empire they derived a more glorious commission from the pope and the republic </s>

<s> It was after the Nycene synod and under the reign of the pious Irene that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne </s>
<s> They were compelled to choose between the rival nations religion was not the sole motive of their choice and while they dissembled the failings of their friends they beheld with reluctance and suspicion the Catholic virtues of their foes </s>
<s> The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years </s>
<s> In that schism the Romans had tasted of freedom and the popes of sovereignty their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence as well as the tyranny of the Byzantine court </s>

<s> 87 The Greeks were now orthodox but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch the Franks were now contumacious but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion from the use to the adoration of images </s>
<s> The name of Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes but the conqueror himself conformed with the temper of a statesman to the various practice of France and Italy </s>
<s> In his four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety knelt before the tomb and consequently before the image of the apostle and joined without scruple in all the prayers and processions of the Roman liturgy </s>
<s> Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor </s>
<s> Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate </s>
<s> Had they power to abolish his government of Rome </s>
<s> The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne and it was only by reviving the Western empire that they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment </s>
<s> By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks from the debasement of a provincial town the majesty of Rome would be restored the Latin Christians would be united under a supreme head in their ancient metropolis and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown from the successors of St. Peter </s>

<s> Almost all these moderns have some religious or national bias.] The appellation of great has been often bestowed and sometimes deserved but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favor the title has been indissolubly blended with the name </s>
<s> That name with the addition of saint is inserted in the Roman calendar and the saint by a rare felicity is crowned with the praises of the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age </s>
<s> 95 His real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation and the times from which he emerged but the apparent magnitude of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison and the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendor from the nakedness of the surrounding desert </s>
<s> Without injustice to his fame I may discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the restorer of the Western empire </s>
<s> Of his moral virtues chastity is not the most conspicuous 96 but the public happiness could not be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines the various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours the multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church and the long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters 97 whom the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion </s>
<s> I shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a conqueror but in a day of equal retribution the sons of his brother Carloman the Merovingian princes of Aquitain and the four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same spot would have something to allege against the justice and humanity of Charlemagne </s>
<s> His treatment of the vanquished Saxons 98 was an abuse of the right of conquest his laws were not less sanguinary than his arms and in the discussion of his motives whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper </s>
<s> The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind and body and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished at his sudden presence at the moment when they believed him at the most distant extremity of the empire neither peace nor war nor summer nor winter were a season of repose and our fancy cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the geography of his expeditions </s>
<s> ! But this activity was a national rather than a personal virtue the vagrant life of a Frank was spent in the chase in pilgrimage in military adventures and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose </s>
<s> His military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops his enemies and his actions </s>
<s> Alexander conquered with the arms of Philip but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed him their name their examples and the companions of their victories </s>
<s> At the head of his veteran and superior armies he oppressed the savage or degenerate nations who were incapable of confederating for their common safety nor did he ever encounter an equal antagonist in numbers in discipline or in arms The science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of singular difficulty and success and he might behold with envy the Saracen trophies of his grandfather </s>
<s> After the Spanish expedition his rearguard was defeated in the Pyrenaean mountains and the soldiers whose situation was irretrievable and whose valor was useless might accuse with their last breath the want of skill or caution of their general </s>
<s> 99 I touch with reverence the laws of Charlemagne so highly applauded by a respectable judge </s>
<s> They compose not a system but a series of occasional and minute edicts for the correction of abuses the reformation of manners the economy of his farms the care of his poultry and even the sale of his eggs </s>
<s> He wished to improve the laws and the character of the Franks and his attempts however feeble and imperfect are deserving of praise the inveterate evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government 100 but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general views and the immortal spirit of a legislator who survives himself for the benefit of posterity </s>
<s> The union and stability of his empire depended on the life of a single man he imitated the dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons and after his numerous diets the whole constitution was left to fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism </s>
<s> His esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil jurisdiction and his son Lewis when he was stripped and degraded by the bishops might accuse in some measure the imprudence of his father </s>
<s> His laws enforced the imposition of tithes because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity </s>
<s> 101 The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation of schools the introduction of arts the works which were published in his name and his familiar connection with the subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate both the prince and people </s>
<s> His own studies were tardy laborious and imperfect if he spoke Latin and understood Greek he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation rather than from books and in his mature age the emperor strove to acquire the practice of writing which every peasant now learns in his infancy </s>
<s> 102 The grammar and logic the music and astronomy of the times were only cultivated as the handmaids of superstition but the curiosity of the human mind must ultimately tend to its improvement and the encouragement of learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the character of Charlemagne </s>
<s> 103 The dignity of his person 104 the length of his reign the prosperity of his arms the vigor of his government and the reverence of distant nations distinguish him from the royal crowd and Europe dates a new aera from his restoration of the Western empire </s>

<s> If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture it will be seen that the empire of the Franks extended between east and west from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula between the north and south from the duchy of Beneventum to the River Eyder the perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark </s>
<s> The personal and political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress and division of the rest of Europe </s>
<s> The islands of Great Britain and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or Scottish origin and after the loss of Spain the Christian and Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow range of the Asturian mountains </s>
<s> These petty sovereigns revered the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch implored the honor and support of his alliance and styled him their common parent the sole and supreme emperor of the West </s>
<s> 113 He maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al Rashid 114 whose dominion stretched from Africa to India and accepted from his ambassadors a tent a waterclock an elephant and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre </s>
<s> It is not easy to conceive the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab who were strangers to each other's person and language and religion but their public correspondence was founded on vanity and their remote situation left no room for a competition of interest </s>
<s> Two thirds of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne and the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany </s>
<s> But in the choice of his enemies we may be reasonably surprised that he so often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the south </s>
<s> The threeandthirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy and the Saracens from Spain </s>
<s> The weakness of the Greeks would have insured an easy victory and the holy crusade against the Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge and loudly justified by religion and policy </s>
<s> Perhaps in his expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe he aspired to save his monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire to disarm the enemies of civilized society and to eradicate the seed of future emigrations </s>
<s> But it has been wisely observed that in a light of precaution all conquest must be ineffectual unless it could be universal since the increasing circle must be involved in a larger sphere of hostility </s>
<s> 115 The subjugation of Germany withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe and awakened the torpid courage of their barbarous natives </s>
<s> The fiercest of the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their brethren of the North the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered with their piratical fleets and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh the destructive progress of the Normans who in less than seventy years precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy </s>

<s> 116 The same ceremony was repeated though with less energy in the subsequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second the Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a lineal descent of four generations and the ambition of the popes was reduced to the empty honor of crowning and anointing these hereditary princes who were already invested with their power and dominions </s>
<s> The pious Lewis survived his brothers and embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne but the nations and the nobles his bishops and his children quickly discerned that this mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul and the foundations were undermined to the centre while the external surface was yet fair and entire </s>
<s> After a war or battle which consumed one hundred thousand Franks the empire was divided by treaty between his three sons who had violated every filial and fraternal duty </s>
<s> The kingdoms of Germany and France were forever separated the provinces of Gaul between the Rhone and the Alps the Meuse and the Rhine were assigned with Italy to the Imperial dignity of Lothaire </s>
<s> In the partition of his share Lorraine and Arles two recent and transitory kingdoms were bestowed on the younger children and Lewis the Second his eldest son was content with the realm of Italy the proper and sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor </s>
<s> On his death without any male issue the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and cousins and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of judging the claims and merits of the candidates and of bestowing on the most obsequious or most liberal the Imperial office of advocate of the Roman church </s>
<s> The dregs of the Carlovingian race no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power and the ridiculous epithets of the bard the stammerer the fat and the simple distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of kings alike deserving of oblivion </s>

<s> Far different was the situation of the German Caesars who were ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy </s>
<s> Their patrimonial estates were stretched along the Rhine or scattered in the provinces but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence or distress of successive princes and their revenue from minute and vexatious prerogative was scarcely sufficient for the maintenance of their household </s>
<s> Their troops were formed by the legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals who passed the Alps with reluctance assumed the license of rapine and disorder and capriciously deserted before the end of the campaign </s>
<s> Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential influence of the climate the survivors brought back the bones of their princes and nobles 142 and the effects of their own intemperance were often imputed to the treachery and malice of the Italians who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the Barbarians </s>
<s> This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms with the petty tyrants of Italy nor can the people or the reader be much interested in the event of the quarrel </s>
<s> But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries the Lombards rekindled the flame of industry and freedom and the generous example was at length imitated by the republics of Tuscany </s>
<s> In the Italian cities a municipal government had never been totally abolished and their first privileges were granted by the favor and policy of the emperors who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier against the independence of the nobles </s>
<s> But their rapid progress the daily extension of their power and pretensions were founded on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities </s>
<s> 143 Each city filled the measure of her diocese or district the jurisdiction of the counts and bishops of the marquises and counts was banished from the land and the proudest nobles were persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles and to embrace the more honorable character of freemen and magistrates </s>
<s> The legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls annually chosen from the three orders of captains valvassors 144 and commons into which the republic was divided </s>
<s> Under the protection of equal law the labors of agriculture and commerce were gradually revived but the martial spirit of the Lombards was nourished by the presence of danger and as often as the bell was rung or the standard 145 erected the gates of the city poured forth a numerous and intrepid band whose zeal in their own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms </s>

<s> Whatever had been seized by violence was ratified by favor or distress was granted as the price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service whatever had been granted to one could not without injury be denied to his successor or equal and every act of local or temporary possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the Germanic kingdom </s>

<s> Generations and ages might roll away in silent oblivion and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence to the narrow margin of the seacoast </s>
<s> But in an early period of antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene of misery and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a people of hunters they rose at once to the more secure and plentiful condition of the pastoral life </s>

<s> The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be extended beyond the visible sphere and some metaphysical powers were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the resurrection of bodies a camel was left to perish on the grave that he might serve his master in another life and the invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still endowed with consciousness and power </s>

<s> The religions of the Sabians and Magians of the Jews and Christians were disseminated from the Persian Gulf to the Red Sea </s>
<s> In a remote period of antiquity Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans 55 and the arms of the Assyrians </s>
<s> From the observations of two thousand years the priests and astronomers of Babylon 56 deduced the eternal laws of nature and providence </s>
<s> They adored the seven gods or angels who directed the course of the seven planets and shed their irresistible influence on the earth </s>
<s> The attributes of the seven planets with the twelve signs of the zodiac and the twentyfour constellations of the northern and southern hemisphere were represented by images and talismans the seven days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities the Sabians prayed thrice each day and the temple of the moon at Haran was the term of their pilgrimage </s>
<s> 57 But the flexible genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to learn in the tradition of the creation the deluge and the patriarchs they held a singular agreement with their Jewish captives they appealed to the secret books of Adam Seth and Enoch and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John in the territory of Bassora </s>

<s> The Christian missionaries were still more active and successful the Catholics asserted their universal reign the sects whom they oppressed successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire the Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions and apocryphal gospels the churches of Yemen and the princes of Hira and Gassan were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite and Nestorian bishops </s>
<s> 60 The liberty of choice was presented to the tribes each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private religion and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with the sublime theology of saints and philosophers </s>
<s> A fundamental article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned strangers the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above the powers of heaven and earth but who has often revealed himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets and whose grace or justice has interrupted by seasonable miracles the order of nature </s>
<s> The most rational of the Arabs acknowledged his power though they neglected his worship 61 and it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to the relics of idolatry </s>

<s> In the familiar offices of life he scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of his country his respectful attention to the rich and powerful was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest citizens of Mecca the frankness of his manner concealed the artifice of his views and the habits of courtesy were imputed to personal friendship or universal benevolence </s>
<s> His memory was capacious and retentive his wit easy and social his imagination sublime his judgment clear rapid and decisive </s>
<s> He possessed the courage both of thought and action and although his designs might gradually expand with his success the first idea which he entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original and superior genius </s>
<s> The son of Abdallah was educated in the bosom of the noblest race in the use of the purest dialect of Arabia and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence </s>
<s> With these powers of eloquence Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian his youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and writing 70 the common ignorance exempted him from shame or reproach but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence and deprived of those faithful mirrors which reflect to our mind the minds of sages and heroes </s>
<s> Yet the book of nature and of man was open to his view and some fancy has been indulged in the political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to the Arabian traveller </s>
<s> 71 He compares the nations and the regions of the earth discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman monarchies beholds with pity and indignation the degeneracy of the times and resolves to unite under one God and one king the invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs </s>
<s> Our more accurate inquiry will suggest that instead of visiting the courts the camps the temples of the East the two journeys of Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and Damascus that he was only thirteen years of age when he accompanied the caravan of his uncle and that his duty compelled him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of Cadijah </s>
<s> In these hasty and superficial excursions the eye of genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser companions some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful soil but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked his curiosity and I cannot perceive in the life or writings of Mahomet that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of the Arabian world </s>

<s> From his earliest youth Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation each year during the month of Ramadan he withdrew from the world and from the arms of Cadijah in the cave of Hera three miles from Mecca 73 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm whose abode is not in the heavens but in the mind of the prophet </s>

<s> According to the tradition of the nocturnal journey the apostle in his personal conference with the Deity was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily obligation of fifty prayers </s>
<s> By the advice of Moses he applied for an alleviation of this intolerable burden the number was gradually reduced to five without any dispensation of business or pleasure or time or place the devotion of the faithful is repeated at daybreak at noon in the afternoon in the evening and at the first watch of the night and in the present decay of religious fervor our travellers are edified by the profound humility and attention of the Turks and Persians </s>

<s> The words and attitudes of supplication as it is performed either sitting or standing or prostrate on the ground are prescribed by custom or authority but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent ejaculations the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious liturgy and each Mussulman for his own person is invested with the character of a priest </s>
<s> Among the theists who reject the use of images it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings of the fancy by directing the eye and the thought towards a kebla or visible point of the horizon </s>
<s> The prophet was at first inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem but he soon returned to a more natural partiality and five times every day the eyes of the nations at Astracan at Fez at Delhi are devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca </s>
<s> Yet every spot for the service of God is equally pure the Mahometans indifferently pray in their chamber or in the street </s>
<s> As a distinction from the Jews and Christians the Friday in each week is set apart for the useful institution of public worship the people is assembled in the mosch and the imam some respectable elder ascends the pulpit to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon </s>

<s> II </s>
<s> The voluntary 102 penance of the ascetics the torment and glory of their lives was odious to a prophet who censured in his companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh and women and sleep and firmly declared that he would suffer no monks in his religion </s>
<s> 103 Yet he instituted in each year a fast of thirty days and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline which purifies the soul and subdues the body as a salutary exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle </s>
<s> During the month of Ramadan from the rising to the setting of the sun the Mussulman abstains from eating and drinking and women and baths and perfumes from all nourishment that can restore his strength from all pleasure that can gratify his senses </s>
<s> In the revolution of the lunar year the Ramadan coincides by turns with the winter cold and the summer heat and the patient martyr without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water must expect the close of a tedious and sultry day </s>
<s> The interdiction of wine peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits is converted by Mahomet alone into a positive and general law 104 and a considerable portion of the globe has abjured at his command the use of that salutary though dangerous liquor </s>

<s> By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for extending even to themselves the hope of salvation for asserting the blackest heresy that every man who believes in God and accomplishes good works may expect in the last day a favorable sentence </s>

<s> It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell with rapture on the groves the fountains and the rivers of paradise but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a liberal taste for harmony and science conversation and friendship he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds the robes of silk palaces of marble dishes of gold rich wines artificial dainties numerous attendants and the whole train of sensual and costly luxury which becomes insipid to the owner even in the short period of this mortal life </s>

<s> Citizens and pilgrims listen not to the tempter hearken not to his impious novelties </s>
<s> Stand fast in the worship of Al Lata and Al Uzzah </s>
<s> Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the aged chief and he protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults of the Koreishites who had long been jealous of the preeminence of the family of Hashem </s>
<s> Their malice was colored with the pretence of religion in the age of Job the crime of impiety was punished by the Arabian magistrate 116 and Mahomet was guilty of deserting and denying the national deities </s>
<s> But so loose was the policy of Mecca that the leaders of the Koreish instead of accusing a criminal were compelled to employ the measures of persuasion or violence </s>
<s> They repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in the style of reproach and menace </s>
<s> Thy nephew reviles our religion he accuses our wise forefathers of ignorance and folly silence him quickly lest he kindle tumult and discord in the city </s>
<s> If he persevere we shall draw our swords against him and his adherents and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of thy fellowcitizens </s>
<s> The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded the violence of religious faction the most helpless or timid of the disciples retired to Aethiopia and the prophet withdrew himself to various places of strength in the town and country </s>
<s> As he was still supported by his family the rest of the tribe of Koreish engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the children of Hashem neither to buy nor sell neither to marry not to give in marriage but to pursue them with implacable enmity till they should deliver the person of Mahomet to the justice of the gods </s>
<s> The decree was suspended in the Caaba before the eyes of the nation the messengers of the Koreish pursued the Mussulman exiles in the heart of Africa they besieged the prophet and his most faithful followers intercepted their water and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of injuries and insults </s>
<s> A doubtful truce restored the appearances of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the power of his enemies at the moment when he was deprived of his domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous Cadijah </s>
<s> Abu Sophian the chief of the branch of Ommiyah succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca </s>
<s> A zealous votary of the idols a mortal foe of the line of Hashem he convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies to decide the fate of the apostle </s>
<s> His imprisonment might provoke the despair of his enthusiasm and the exile of an eloquent and popular fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces of Arabia </s>
<s> His death was resolved and they agreed that a sword from each tribe should be buried in his heart to divide the guilt of his blood and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites </s>
<s> An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy and flight was the only resource of Mahomet </s>
<s> 117 At the dead of night accompanied by his friend Abubeker he silently escaped from his house the assassins watched at the door but they were deceived by the figure of Ali who reposed on the bed and was covered with the green vestment of the apostle </s>
<s> The Koreish respected the piety of the heroic youth but some verses of Ali which are still extant exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety his tenderness and his religious confidence </s>
<s> Three days Mahomet and his companion were concealed in the cave of Thor at the distance of a league from Mecca and in the close of each evening they received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of intelligence and food </s>
<s> The diligence of the Koreish explored every haunt in the neighborhood of the city they arrived at the entrance of the cavern but the providential deceit of a spider's web and a pigeon's nest is supposed to convince them that the place was solitary and inviolate </s>
<s> We are only two said the trembling Abubeker </s>
<s> There is a third replied the prophet it is God himself </s>
<s> No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two fugitives issued from the rock and mounted their camels on the road to Medina they were overtaken by the emissaries of the Koreish they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from their hands </s>

<s> To eradicate the seeds of jealousy Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the rights and obligations of brethren and when Ali found himself without a peer the prophet tenderly declared that he would be the companion and brother of the noble youth </s>

<s> Abu Sophian himself with only thirty or forty followers conducted a wealthy caravan of a thousand camels the fortune or dexterity of his march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet but the chief of the Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush to await his return </s>
<s> He despatched a messenger to his brethren of Mecca and they were roused by the fear of losing their merchandise and their provisions unless they hastened to his relief with the military force of the city </s>
<s> The sacred band of Mahomet was formed of three hundred and thirteen Moslems of whom seventyseven were fugitives and the rest auxiliaries they mounted by turns a train of seventy camels the camels of Yathreb were formidable in war but such was the poverty of his first disciples that only two could appear on horseback in the field </s>
<s> 128 In the fertile and famous vale of Beder 129 three stations from Medina he was informed by his scouts of the caravan that approached on one side of the Koreish one hundred horse eight hundred and fifty foot who advanced on the other </s>

<s> O God he exclaimed as the numbers of the Koreish descended from the hills O God if these are destroyed by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth </s>
<s> Courage my children close your ranks discharge your arrows and the day is your own </s>

<s> But it was in vain that the camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and along the Euphrates they were overtaken by the diligence of the Mussulmans and wealthy must have been the prize if twenty thousand drams could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle </s>

<s> The standard of God and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers the disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field of Beder and their presumption of victory prevailed against the divine and human sense of the apostle </s>

<s> The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on the declivity of the hill and their rear was guarded by a detachment of fifty archers </s>

<s> The good sense of Mahomet 158 despised the pomp of royalty the apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family he kindled the fire swept the floor milked the ewes and mended with his own hands his shoes and his woollen garment </s>
<s> Disdaining the penance and merit of a hermit he observed without effort or vanity the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier </s>
<s> On solemn occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable plenty but in his domestic life many weeks would elapse without a tire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet </s>
<s> The interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example his hunger was appeased with a sparing allowance of barleybread he delighted in the taste of milk and honey but his ordinary food consisted of dates and water </s>
<s> Perfumes and women were the two sensual enjoyments which his nature required and his religion did not forbid and Mahomet affirmed that the fervor of his devotion was increased by these innocent pleasures </s>
<s> The heat of the climate inflames the blood of the Arabs and their libidinous complexion has been noticed by the writers of antiquity </s>
<s> 159 Their incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the Koran their incestuous alliances were blamed the boundless license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or concubines their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably determined the freedom of divorce was discouraged adultery was condemned as a capital offence and fornication in either sex was punished with a hundred stripes </s>
<s> 160 Such were the calm and rational precepts of the legislator but in his private conduct Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man and abused the claims of a prophet </s>
<s> A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which he had imposed on his nation the female sex without reserve was abandoned to his desires and this singular prerogative excited the envy rather than the scandal the veneration rather than the envy of the devout Mussulmans </s>
<s> If we remember the seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the wise Solomon we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian who espoused no more than seventeen or fifteen wives eleven are enumerated who occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of the apostle and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal society </s>
<s> What is singular enough they were all widows excepting only Ayesha the daughter of Abubeker </s>
<s> She was doubtless a virgin since Mahomet consummated his nuptials such is the premature ripeness of the climate when she was only nine years of age </s>
<s> The youth the beauty the spirit of Ayesha gave her a superior ascendant she was beloved and trusted by the prophet and after his death the daughter of Abubeker was long revered as the mother of the faithful </s>
<s> Her behavior had been ambiguous and indiscreet in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left behind and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a man </s>
<s> The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy but a divine revelation assured him of her innocence he chastised her accusers and published a law of domestic peace that no woman should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in the act of adultery </s>
<s> 161 In his adventures with Zeineb the wife of Zeid and with Mary an Egyptian captive the amorous prophet forgot the interest of his reputation </s>
<s> At the house of Zeid his freedman and adopted son he beheld in a loose undress the beauty of Zeineb and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion and desire </s>
<s> The servile or grateful freedman understood the hint and yielded without hesitation to the love of his benefactor </s>
<s> But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and scandal the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the deed to annul the adoption and gently to reprove the apostle for distrusting the indulgence of his God </s>
<s> One of his wives Hafna the daughter of Omar surprised him on her own bed in the embraces of his Egyptian captive she promised secrecy and forgiveness he swore that he would renounce the possession of Mary </s>
<s> Both parties forgot their engagements and Gabriel again descended with a chapter of the Koran to absolve him from his oath and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and concubines without listening to the clamors of his wives </s>
<s> In a solitary retreat of thirty days he labored alone with Mary to fulfil the commands of the angel </s>
<s> When his love and revenge were satiated he summoned to his presence his eleven wives reproached their disobedience and indiscretion and threatened them with a sentence of divorce both in this world and in the next a dreadful sentence since those who had ascended the bed of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a second marriage </s>
<s> Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by the tradition of his natural or preternatural gifts 162 he united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of Adam and the apostle might rival the thirteenth labor 163 of the Grecian Hercules </s>
<s> 164 A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn from his fidelity to Cadijah </s>
<s> During the twentyfour years of their marriage her youthful husband abstained from the right of polygamy and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was never insulted by the society of a rival </s>

<s> The glory of Ali is the constant burden of their strain </s>
<s> He was destined and according to some accounts designated for the caliphate by the prophet but while the others were fiercely pushing their own interests Ali was watching the remains of Mahomet with pious fidelity </s>
<s> His disinterested magnanimity on each separate occasion declined the sceptre and gave the noble example of obedience to the appointed caliph </s>
<s> He is described in retirement on the throne and in the field of battle as transcendently pious magnanimous valiant and humane </s>
<s> He lost his empire through his excess of virtue and love for the faithful his life through his confidence in God and submission to the decrees of fate </s>

<s> It is to be regretted I must add that Major Price has contented himself with quoting the names of the Persian works which he follows without any account of their character age and authority </s>
<s> M.] The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the people and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on the choice of his successor </s>
<s> The hereditary claim and lofty spirit of Ali were offensive to an aristocracy of elders desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and frequent election the Koreish could never be reconciled to the proud preeminence of the line of Hashem the ancient discord of the tribes was rekindled the fugitives of Mecca and the auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits and the rash proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have crushed in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens </s>
<s> The tumult was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar who suddenly renouncing his own pretensions stretched forth his hand and declared himself the first subject of the mild and venerable Abubeker </s>
<s> The urgency of the moment and the acquiescence of the people might excuse this illegal and precipitate measure but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit that if any Mulsulman should hereafter presume to anticipate the suffrage of his brethren both the elector and the elected would be worthy of death </s>
<s> 168 After the simple inauguration of Abubeker he was obeyed in Medina Mecca and the provinces of Arabia the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity and their chief in his own house maintained above six months a sullen and independent reserve without listening to the threats of Omar who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the daughter of the apostle </s>
<s> The death of Fatima and the decline of his party subdued the indignant spirit of Ali he condescended to salute the commander of the faithful accepted his excuse of the necessity of preventing their common enemies and wisely rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the Arabians </s>

<s> In his testament with the tacit approbation of his companions he bequeathed the sceptre to the firm and intrepid virtue of Omar </s>
<s> I have no occasion said the modest candidate for the place </s>
<s> But the place has occasion for you replied Abubeker who expired with a fervent prayer that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice and direct the Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience </s>
<s> The prayer was not ineffectual since Ali himself in a life of privacy and prayer professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his rival who comforted him for the loss of empire by the most flattering marks of confidence and esteem </s>
<s> In the twelfth year of his reign Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an assassin he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his son and of Ali refused to load his conscience with the sins of his successor and devolved on six of the most respectable companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the faithful </s>

<s> The increasing myriads who acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet had been compelled by his arms or allured by his prosperity </s>
<s> The polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and invisible God the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator </s>
<s> The habits of faith and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed and many of the new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of Moses or the rites and mysteries of the Catholic church or the idols the sacrifices the joyous festivals of their Pagan ancestors </s>
<s> The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and subordination and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest and most salutary laws that curbed their passions or violated their customs </s>
<s> They submitted with reluctance to the religious precepts of the Koran the abstinence from wine the fast of the Ramadan and the daily repetition of five prayers and the alms and tithes which were collected for the treasury of Medina could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a perpetual and ignominious tribute </s>
<s> The example of Mahomet had excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture and several of his rivals presumed to imitate the conduct and defy the authority of the living prophet </s>
<s> At the head of the fugitives and auxiliaries the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca Medina and Tayef and perhaps the Koreish would have restored the idols of the Caaba if their levity had not been checked by a seasonable reproof </s>

<s> The courage of Abubeker 4 Omar 5 and Othman 6 had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars of the prophet and the personal assurance of paradise must have taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present world </s>
<s> But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most important duties of a sovereign </s>
<s> Except the presence of Omar at the siege of Jerusalem their longest expeditions were the frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca and they calmly received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before the sepulchre of the prophet </s>
<s> The austere and frugal measure of their lives was the effect of virtue or habit and the pride of their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of the earth </s>
<s> When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph he enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his private patrimony that it might be evident whether he were enriched or impoverished by the service of the state </s>
<s> He thought himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold with the sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave but on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own and the public money first to the most worthy and then to the most indigent of the Moslems </s>
<s> The remains of his wealth a coarse garment and five pieces of gold were delivered to his successor who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to equal such an admirable model </s>
<s> Yet the abstinence and humility of Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker his food consisted of barley bread or dates his drink was water he preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places and the Persian satrap who paid his homage to the conqueror found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of Medina </s>
<s> Oeeconomy is the source of liberality and the increase of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual reward for the past and present services of the faithful </s>
<s> Careless of his own emolument he assigned to Abbas the uncle of the prophet the first and most ample allowance of twentyfive thousand drachms or pieces of silver </s>
<s> Five thousand were allotted to each of the aged warriors the relics of the field of Beder and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces </s>
<s> One thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the first battles against the Greeks and Persians and the decreasing pay as low as fifty pieces of silver was adapted to the respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar </s>
<s> Under his reign and that of his predecessor the conquerors of the East were the trusty servants of God and the people the mass of the public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline of the Saracens and they united by a rare felicity the despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal maxims of a republican government </s>
<s> The heroic courage of Ali 7 the consummate prudence of Moawiyah 8 excited the emulation of their subjects and the talents which had been exercised in the school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate the faith and dominion of the prophet </s>
<s> In the sloth and vanity of the palace of Damascus the succeeding princes of the house of Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen and of saints </s>

<s> Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of human rights religion and property and the enmity of the natives seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace and toleration </s>
<s> The sea was continually open and if Heraclius had been awake to the public distress fresh armies of Romans and Barbarians might have been poured into the harbor to save the second capital of the empire </s>
<s> A circumference of ten miles would have scattered the forces of the Greeks and favored the stratagems of an active enemy but the two sides of an oblong square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis and each of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs </s>
<s> The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of the attempt and the value of the prize </s>
<s> From the throne of Medina the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city his voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of Syria and the merit of a holy war was recommended by the peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt </s>
<s> Anxious for the ruin or expulsion of their tyrants the faithful natives devoted their labors to the service of Amrou some sparks of martial spirit were perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies and the sanguine hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church of St. John of Alexandria </s>

<s> In every attack the sword the banner of Amrou glittered in the van of the Moslems </s>
<s> On a memorable day he was betrayed by his imprudent valor his followers who had entered the citadel were driven back and the general with a friend and slave remained a prisoner in the hands of the Christians </s>

<s> The credulous Greek was deceived he listened to the offer of a treaty and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more respectable embassy till the joyful acclamations of the camp announced the return of their general and insulted the folly of the infidels </s>

<s> I should deceive the expectation of the reader if I passed in silence the fate of the Alexandrian library as it is described by the learned Abulpharagius </s>
<s> The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than that of his brethren and in his leisure hours the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of John the last disciple of Ammonius and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and philosophy </s>
<s> 115 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift inestimable in his opinion contemptible in that of the Barbarians the royal library which alone among the spoils of Alexandria had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror </s>
<s> Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph and the wellknown answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic </s>
<s> If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God they are useless and need not be preserved if they disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed </s>
<s> The sentence was executed with blind obedience the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city and such was their incredible multitude that six months were barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel </s>
<s> Since the Dynasties of Abulpharagius 116 have been given to the world in a Latin version the tale has been repeatedly transcribed and every scholar with pious indignation has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning the arts and the genius of antiquity </s>
<s> For my own part I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences </s>
<s> The fact is indeed marvellous </s>
<s> Read and wonder </s>
<s> says the historian himself and the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred years on the confines of Media is overbalanced by the silence of two annalist of a more early date both Christians both natives of Egypt and the most ancient of whom the patriarch Eutychius has amply described the conquest of Alexandria </s>
<s> 117 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare that the religious books of the Jews and Christians which are acquired by the right of war should never be committed to the flames and that the works of profane science historians or poets physicians or philosophers may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful </s>
<s> 118 A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet yet in this instance the conflagration would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials </s>
<s> I should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own defence 119 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry </s>
<s> 120 But if we gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius we shall learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four or the seven hundred thousand volumes which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies </s>
<s> 121 Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books but if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in the public baths 122 a philosopher may allow with a smile that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind </s>
<s> I sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which have been involved in the ruin of the Roman empire but when I seriously compute the lapse of ages the waste of ignorance and the calamities of war our treasures rather than our losses are the objects of my surprise </s>
<s> Many curious and interesting facts are buried in oblivion the three great historians of Rome have been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state and we are deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric iambic and dramatic poetry of the Greeks </s>
<s> Yet we should gratefully remember that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic works to which the suffrage of antiquity 123 had adjudged the first place of genius and glory the teachers of ancient knowledge who are still extant had perused and compared the writings of their predecessors 124 nor can it fairly be presumed that any important truth any useful discovery in art or nature has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages </s>

<s> I should deceive the expectation of the reader if I passed in silence the fate of the Alexandrian library as it is described by the learned Abulpharagius </s>
<s> The spirit of Amrou was more curious and liberal than that of his brethren and in his leisure hours the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of John the last disciple of Ammonius and who derived the surname of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and philosophy </s>
<s> 115 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift inestimable in his opinion contemptible in that of the Barbarians the royal library which alone among the spoils of Alexandria had not been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror </s>
<s> Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian but his rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without the consent of the caliph and the wellknown answer of Omar was inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic </s>
<s> If these writings of the Greeks agree with the book of God they are useless and need not be preserved if they disagree they are pernicious and ought to be destroyed </s>
<s> The sentence was executed with blind obedience the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four thousand baths of the city and such was their incredible multitude that six months were barely sufficient for the consumption of this precious fuel </s>
<s> Since the Dynasties of Abulpharagius 116 have been given to the world in a Latin version the tale has been repeatedly transcribed and every scholar with pious indignation has deplored the irreparable shipwreck of the learning the arts and the genius of antiquity </s>
<s> For my own part I am strongly tempted to deny both the fact and the consequences </s>

<s> 117 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they expressly declare that the religious books of the Jews and Christians which are acquired by the right of war should never be committed to the flames and that the works of profane science historians or poets physicians or philosophers may be lawfully applied to the use of the faithful </s>
<s> 118 A more destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first successors of Mahomet yet in this instance the conflagration would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials </s>
<s> I should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own defence 119 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians who studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry </s>
<s> 120 But if we gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of Theodosius we shall learn from a chain of contemporary witnesses that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no longer contained the four or the seven hundred thousand volumes which had been assembled by the curiosity and magnificence of the Ptolemies </s>
<s> 121 Perhaps the church and seat of the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books but if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were indeed consumed in the public baths 122 a philosopher may allow with a smile that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of mankind </s>

<s> The Greeks had little to hope nor had their enemies any reason of fear from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor who disgraced the name of Constantine and imitated only the inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius </s>
<s> Without delay or opposition the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the unguarded channel of the Hellespont which even now under the feeble and disorderly government of the Turks is maintained as the natural bulwark of the capital </s>
<s> 3 The Arabian fleet cast anchor and the troops were disembarked near the palace of Hebdomon seven miles from the city </s>

<s> The solid and lofty walls were guarded by numbers and discipline the spirit of the Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and empire the fugitives from the conquered provinces more successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria and the Saracens were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects of artificial fire </s>

<s> So patient was their perseverance or so languid were their operations that they repeated in the six following summers the same attack and retreat with a gradual abatement of hope and vigor till the mischances of shipwreck and disease of the sword and of fire compelled them to relinquish the fruitless enterprise </s>

<s> The precautions of Anastasius were not unworthy of his station or of the impending danger </s>
<s> He issued a peremptory mandate that all persons who were not provided with the means of subsistence for a three years' siege should evacuate the city the public granaries and arsenals were abundantly replenished the walls were restored and strengthened and the engines for casting stones or darts or fire were stationed along the ramparts or in the brigantines of war of which an additional number was hastily constructed </s>
<s> To prevent is safer as well as more honorable than to repel an attack and a design was meditated above the usual spirit of the Greeks of burning the naval stores of the enemy the cypress timber that had been hewn in Mount Libanus and was piled along the seashore of Phoenicia for the service of the Egyptian fleet </s>
<s> This generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of the troops who in the new language of the empire were styled of the Obsequian Theme </s>

<s> ! The Greeks would gladly have ransomed their religion and empire by a fine or assessment of a piece of gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city but the liberal offer was rejected with disdain and the presumption of Moslemah was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the natives of Egypt and Syria </s>
<s> They are said to have amounted to eighteen hundred ships the number betrays their inconsiderable size and of the twenty stout and capacious vessels whose magnitude impeded their progress each was manned with no more than one hundred heavyarmed soldiers </s>
<s> This huge armada proceeded on a smooth sea and with a gentle gale towards the mouth of the Bosphorus the surface of the strait was overshadowed in the language of the Greeks with a moving forest and the same fatal night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault by sea and land </s>
<s> To allure the confidence of the enemy the emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the entrance of the harbor but while they hesitated whether they should seize the opportunity or apprehend the snare the ministers of destruction were at hand </s>
<s> The fireships of the Greeks were launched against them the Arabs their arms and vessels were involved in the same flames the disorderly fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the waves and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet that had threatened to extirpate the Roman name </s>

<s> ! </s>
<s> While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind conscience the siege was continued through the winter by the neglect rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar </s>

<s> They revived on the return of spring a second effort had been made in their favor and their distress was relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets laden with corn and arms and soldiers the first from Alexandria of four hundred transports and galleys the second of three hundred and sixty vessels from the ports of Africa </s>
<s> But the Greek fires were again kindled and if the destruction was less complete it was owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at a safe distance or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners who deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians </s>
<s> The trade and navigation of the capital were restored and the produce of the fisheries supplied the wants and even the luxury of the inhabitants </s>
<s> But the calamities of famine and disease were soon felt by the troops of Moslemah and as the former was miserably assuaged so the latter was dreadfully propagated by the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract from the most unclean or unnatural food </s>
<s> The spirit of conquest and even of enthusiasm was extinct the Saracens could no longer struggle beyond their lines either single or in small parties without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the Thracian peasants </s>
<s> An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts and promises of Leo and these savage auxiliaries made some atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire by the defeat and slaughter of twentytwo thousand Asiatics </s>

<s> 16 The important secret of compounding and directing this artificial flame was imparted by Callinicus a native of Heliopolis in Syria who deserted from the service of the caliph to that of the emperor </s>
<s> 17 The skill of a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succor of fleets and armies and this discovery or improvement of the military art was fortunately reserved for the distressful period when the degenerate Romans of the East were incapable of contending with the warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigor of the Saracens </s>
<s> The historian who presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine guides so prone to the marvellous so careless and in this instance so jealous of the truth </s>
<s> From their obscure and perhaps fallacious hints it should seem that the principal ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha 18 or liquid bitumen a light tenacious and inflammable oil 19 which springs from the earth and catches fire as soon as it comes in contact with the air </s>
<s> The naphtha was mingled I know not by what methods or in what proportions with sulphur and with the pitch that is extracted from evergreen firs </s>
<s> 20 From this mixture which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion proceeded a fierce and obstinate flame which not only rose in perpendicular ascent but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or lateral progress instead of being extinguished it was nourished and quickened by the element of water and sand urine or vinegar were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this powerful agent which was justly denominated by the Greeks the liquid or the maritime fire </s>
<s> For the annoyance of the enemy it was employed with equal effect by sea and land in battles or in sieges </s>
<s> It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers or launched in redhot balls of stone and iron or darted in arrows and javelins twisted round with flax and tow which had deeply imbibed the inflammable oil sometimes it was deposited in fireships the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which were planted on the prow of a galley and fancifully shaped into the mouths of savage monsters that seemed to vomit a stream of liquid and consuming fire </s>
<s> This important art was preserved at Constantinople as the palladium of the state the galleys and artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome but the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most jealous scruple and the terror of the enemies was increased and prolonged by their ignorance and surprise </s>
<s> In the treaties of the administration of the empire the royal author 21 suggests the answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians </s>
<s> They should be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines with a sacred injunction that this gift of Heaven this peculiar blessing of the Romans should never be communicated to any foreign nation that the prince and the subject were alike bound to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties of treason and sacrilege and that the impious attempt would provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the Christians </s>
<s> By these precautions the secret was confined above four hundred years to the Romans of the East and at the end of the eleventh century the Pisans to whom every sea and every art were familiar suffered the effects without understanding the composition of the Greek fire </s>
<s> It was at length either discovered or stolen by the Mahometans and in the holy wars of Syria and Egypt they retorted an invention contrived against themselves on the heads of the Christians </s>
<s> A knight who despised the swords and lances of the Saracens relates with heartfelt sincerity his own fears and those of his companions at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged a torrent of the Greek fire the feu Gregeois as it is styled by the more early of the French writers </s>

<s> An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city the tombs of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century and many thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid stream into the Mediterranean Sea </s>
<s> The arms of Abderame were not less successful on the side of the ocean </s>
<s> He passed without opposition the Garonne and Dordogne which unite their waters in the Gulf of Bourdeaux but he found beyond those rivers the camp of the intrepid Eudes who had formed a second army and sustained a second defeat so fatal to the Christians that according to their sad confession God alone could reckon the number of the slain </s>
<s> The victorious Saracen overran the provinces of Aquitain whose Gallic names are disguised rather than lost in the modern appellations of Perigord Saintonge and Poitou his standards were planted on the walls or at least before the gates of Tours and of Sens and his detachments overspread the kingdom of Burgundy as far as the wellknown cities of Lyons and Besancon </s>
<s> The memory of these devastations for Abderame did not spare the country or the people was long preserved by tradition and the invasion of France by the Moors or Mahometans affords the groundwork of those fables which have been so wildly disfigured in the romances of chivalry and so elegantly adorned by the Italian muse </s>
<s> In the decline of society and art the deserted cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens their richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries which they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames and the tutelar saints both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own sepulchres </s>
<s> 29 A victorious line of march had been prolonged above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of the Loire the repetition of an equal space would have carried the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of Scotland the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or Euphrates and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a naval combat into the mouth of the Thames </s>

<s> This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement of the Arabian writers and the situation of Charles will suggest a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination the secret desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the rebel duke of Aquitain </s>
<s> It is yet more probable that the delays of Charles were inevitable and reluctant </s>
<s> A standing army was unknown under the first and second race more than half the kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens according to their respective situation the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were to conscious or too careless of the impending danger and the voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a long interval from the standard of the Christian general </s>

<s> In the disorder and despair of the night the various tribes of Yemen and Damascus of Africa and Spain were provoked to turn their arms against each other the remains of their host were suddenly dissolved and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and separate retreat </s>
<s> At the dawn of the day the stillness of a hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians on the report of their spies they ventured to explore the riches of the vacant tents but if we except some celebrated relics a small portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful owners </s>
<s> The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic world and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three hundred and fifty or three hundred and seventyfive thousand of the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles 32 while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the field of Tours </s>
<s> But this incredible tale is sufficiently disproved by the caution of the French general who apprehended the snares and accidents of a pursuit and dismissed his German allies to their native forests </s>
<s> The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and blood and the most cruel execution is inflicted not in the ranks of battle but on the backs of a flying enemy </s>

<s> 55 The shelves were crowded with orators and poets whose style was adapted to the taste and manners of their countrymen with general and partial histories which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of persons and events with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence which derived their authority from the law of the prophet with the interpreters of the Koran and orthodox tradition and with the whole theological tribe polemics mystics scholastics and moralists the first or the last of writers according to the different estimates of sceptics or believers </s>
<s> The works of speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of philosophy mathematics astronomy and physic </s>
<s> The sages of Greece were translated and illustrated in the Arabic language and some treatises now lost in the original have been recovered in the versions of the East 56 which possessed and studied the writings of Aristotle and Plato of Euclid and Apollonius of Ptolemy Hippocrates and Galen </s>
<s> 57 Among the ideal systems which have varied with the fashion of the times the Arabians adopted the philosophy of the Stagirite alike intelligible or alike obscure for the readers of every age </s>
<s> Plato wrote for the Athenians and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with the language and religion of Greece </s>
<s> After the fall of that religion the Peripatetics emerging from their obscurity prevailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects and their founder was long afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain to the Latin schools </s>
<s> 58 The physics both of the Academy and the Lycaeum as they are built not on observation but on argument have retarded the progress of real knowledge </s>
<s> The metaphysics of infinite or finite spirit have too often been enlisted in the service of superstition </s>
<s> But the human faculties are fortified by the art and practice of dialectics the ten predicaments of Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas 59 and his syllogism is the keenest weapon of dispute </s>
<s> It was dexterously wielded in the schools of the Saracens but as it is more effectual for the detection of error than for the investigation of truth it is not surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should still revolve in the same circle of logical argument </s>
<s> The mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege that in the course of ages they may always advance and can never recede </s>
<s> But the ancient geometry if I am not misinformed was resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth century and whatever may be the origin of the name the science of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest testimony of the Arabs themselves </s>
<s> 60 They cultivated with more success the sublime science of astronomy which elevates the mind of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence </s>
<s> The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph Almamon and the land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same spacious level the same unclouded horizon </s>
<s> In the plains of Sinaar and a second time in those of Cufa his mathematicians accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth and determined at twentyfour thousand miles the entire circumference of our globe </s>
<s> 61 From the reign of the Abbassides to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane the stars without the aid of glasses were diligently observed and the astronomical tables of Bagdad Spain and Samarcand 62 correct some minute errors without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar system </s>
<s> In the Eastern courts the truths of science could be recommended only by ignorance and folly and the astronomer would have been disregarded had he not debased his wisdom or honesty by the vain predictions of astrology </s>
<s> 63 But in the science of medicine the Arabians have been deservedly applauded </s>
<s> The names of Mesua and Geber of Razis and Avicenna are ranked with the Grecian masters in the city of Bagdad eight hundred and sixty physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession 64 in Spain the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to the skill of the Saracens 65 and the school of Salerno their legitimate offspring revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of the healing art </s>
<s> 66 The success of each professor must have been influenced by personal and accidental causes but we may form a less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy 67 botany 68 and chemistry 69 the threefold basis of their theory and practice </s>
<s> A superstitious reverence for the dead confined both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection of apes and quadrupeds the more solid and visible parts were known in the time of Galen and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists </s>
<s> Botany is an active science and the discoveries of the torrid zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand plants </s>
<s> Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the temples and monasteries of Egypt much useful experience had been acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures but the science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the industry of the Saracens </s>
<s> They first invented and named the alembic for the purposes of distillation analyzed the substances of the three kingdoms of nature tried the distinction and affinities of alcalis and acids and converted the poisonous minerals into soft and salutary medicines </s>
<s> But the most eager search of Arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals and the elixir of immortal health the reason and the fortunes of thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy and the consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of mystery fable and superstition </s>

<s> The Christian idols were stripped of their costly offerings a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St. Peter and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire their deliverance must be imputed to the haste rather than the scruples of the Saracens </s>
<s> In their course along the Appian way they pillaged Fundi and besieged Gayeta but they had turned aside from the walls of Rome and by their divisions the Capitol was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca </s>
<s> The same danger still impended on the heads of the Roman people and their domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir </s>

<s> They kissed his feet received the communion with martial devotion and listened to the prayer of Leo that the same God who had supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of the sea would strengthen the hands of his champions against the adversaries of his holy name </s>
<s> After a similar prayer and with equal resolution the Moslems advanced to the attack of the Christian galleys which preserved their advantageous station along the coast </s>
<s> The victory inclined to the side of the allies when it was less gloriously decided in their favor by a sudden tempest which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest mariners </s>
<s> The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the rocks and islands of a hostile shore </s>
<s> Those who escaped from shipwreck and hunger neither found nor deserved mercy at the hands of their implacable pursuers </s>
<s> The sword and the gibbet reduced the dangerous multitude of captives and the remainder was more usefully employed to restore the sacred edifices which they had attempted to subvert </s>
<s> The pontiff at the head of the citizens and allies paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of the apostles and among the spoils of this naval victory thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee </s>

<s> She was entertained in the Byzantine palace with filial reverence and the honors of a queen and whatever might be the origin of her wealth her gifts were not unworthy of the regal dignity </s>
<s> I have already described the fine and curious manufactures of Peloponnesus of linen silk and woollen but the most acceptable of her presents consisted in three hundred beautiful youths of whom one hundred were eunuchs 38 for she was not ignorant says the historian that the air of the palace is more congenial to such insects than a shepherd's dairy to the flies of the summer </s>
<s> During her lifetime she bestowed the greater part of her estates in Peloponnesus and her testament instituted Leo the son of Basil her universal heir </s>

<s> The Bulgarians were sincere and devout Christians and the safety of the empire with the redemption of many thousand captives depended on this preposterous alliance </s>

<s> They alone were excepted from the general prohibition Hugo king of France was the lineal descendant of Charlemagne 62 and his daughter Bertha inherited the prerogatives of her family and nation </s>
<s> The voice of truth and malice insensibly betrayed the fraud or error of the Imperial court </s>

<s> 63 The daughter of Venus was granted to the solicitations of the Byzantine court her name of Bertha was changed to that of Eudoxia and she was wedded or rather betrothed to young Romanus the future heir of the empire of the East </s>
<s> The consummation of this foreign alliance was suspended by the tender age of the two parties and at the end of five years the union was dissolved by the death of the virgin spouse </s>
<s> The second wife of the emperor Romanus was a maiden of plebeian but of Roman birth and their two daughters Theophano and Anne were given in marriage to the princes of the earth </s>
<s> The eldest was bestowed as the pledge of peace on the eldest son of the great Otho who had solicited this alliance with arms and embassies </s>

<s> If the ranks of the infantry or cavalry were sometimes doubled this cautious array betrayed a secret distrust of the courage of the troops whose numbers might swell the appearance of the line but of whom only a chosen band would dare to encounter the spears and swords of the Barbarians </s>

<s> In the profession of Christianity the variety of national characters may be clearly distinguished </s>
<s> The natives of Syria and Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world and the wit of the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of metaphysical theology </s>
<s> The incomprehensible mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation instead of commanding their silent submission were agitated in vehement and subtile controversies which enlarged their faith at the expense perhaps of their charity and reason </s>
<s> From the council of Nice to the end of the seventh century the peace and unity of the church was invaded by these spiritual wars and so deeply did they affect the decline and fall of the empire that the historian has too often been compelled to attend the synods to explore the creeds and to enumerate the sects of this busy period of ecclesiastical annals </s>
<s> From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages of the Byzantine empire the sound of controversy was seldom heard curiosity was exhausted zeal was fatigued and in the decrees of six councils the articles of the Catholic faith had been irrevocably defined </s>
<s> The spirit of dispute however vain and pernicious requires some energy and exercise of the mental faculties and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast to pray and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his clergy </s>
<s> During a long dream of superstition the Virgin and the Saints their visions and miracles their relics and images were preached by the monks and worshipped by the people and the appellation of people might be extended without injustice to the first ranks of civil society </s>
<s> At an unseasonable moment the Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their subjects under their influence reason might obtain some proselytes a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible deities and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of orthodoxy </s>
<s> In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical rulers were relieved from the toil or deprived of the pleasure of persecution </s>
<s> The Pagans had disappeared the Jews were silent and obscure the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote hostilities against a national enemy and the sects of Egypt and Syria enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian caliphs </s>
<s> About the middle of the seventh century a branch of Manichaeans was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny their patience was at length exasperated to despair and rebellion and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds of reformation </s>
<s> These important events will justify some inquiry into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians 1 and as they cannot plead for themselves our candid criticism will magnify the good and abate or suspect the evil that is reported by their adversaries </s>

<s> M.] The Gnostics who had distracted the infancy were oppressed by the greatness and authority of the church </s>
<s> Instead of emulating or surpassing the wealth learning and numbers of the Catholics their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East and West and confined to the villages and mountains along the borders of the Euphrates </s>
<s> Some vestige of the Marcionites may be detected in the fifth century 2 but the numerous sects were finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans and these heretics who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster and Christ were pursued by the two religions with equal and unrelenting hatred </s>
<s> Under the grandson of Heraclius in the neighborhood of Samosata more famous for the birth of Lucian than for the title of a Syrian kingdom a reformer arose esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth </s>
<s> In his humble dwelling of Mananalis Constantine entertained a deacon who returned from Syrian captivity and received the inestimable gift of the New Testament which was already concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek and perhaps of the Gnostic clergy </s>
<s> 3 These books became the measure of his studies and the rule of his faith and the Catholics who dispute his interpretation acknowledge that his text was genuine and sincere </s>
<s> But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to the writings and character of St. Paul the name of the Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and domestic teacher but I am confident that they gloried in their affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles </s>
<s> His disciples Titus Timothy Sylvanus Tychicus were represented by Constantine and his fellowlaborers the names of the apostolic churches were applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and Cappadocia and this innocent allegory revived the example and memory of the first ages </s>
<s> In the Gospel and the Epistles of St. Paul his faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive Christianity and whatever might be the success a Protestant reader will applaud the spirit of the inquiry </s>
<s> But if the Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure they were not perfect </s>
<s> Their founders rejected the two Epistles of St. Peter 4 the apostle of the circumcision whose dispute with their favorite for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven </s>
<s> 5 They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt for the Old Testament the books of Moses and the prophets which have been consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church </s>
<s> With equal boldness and doubtless with more reason Constantine the new Sylvanus disclaimed the visions which in so many bulky and splendid volumes had been published by the Oriental sects 6 the fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of the East the spurious gospels epistles and acts which in the first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code the theology of Manes and the authors of the kindred heresies and the thirty generations or aeons which had been created by the fruitful fancy of Valentine </s>

<s> The early separation of the Gnostics had preceded the establishment of the Catholic worship and against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion as by the silence of St. Paul and the evangelists </s>
<s> The objects which had been transformed by the magic of superstition appeared to the eyes of the Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors </s>
<s> An image made without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist to whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their merit or value </s>
<s> The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and ashes destitute of life or virtue or of any relation perhaps with the person to whom they were ascribed </s>
<s> The true and vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber the body and blood of Christ a loaf of bread and a cup of wine the gifts of nature and the symbols of grace </s>
<s> The mother of God was degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity and the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the laborious office of meditation in heaven and ministry upon earth </s>
<s> In the practice or at least in the theory of the sacraments the Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of worship and the words of the gospel were in their judgment the baptism and communion of the faithful </s>
<s> They indulged a convenient latitude for the interpretation of Scripture and as often as they were pressed by the literal sense they could escape to the intricate mazes of figure and allegory </s>
<s> Their utmost diligence must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the Old and the New Testament since they adored the latter as the oracles of God and abhorred the former as the fabulous and absurd invention of men or daemons </s>
<s> We cannot be surprised that they should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the Trinity but instead of confessing the human nature and substantial sufferings of Christ they amused their fancy with a celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through a pipe with a fantastic crucifixion that eluded the vain and important malice of the Jews </s>
<s> A creed thus simple and spiritual was not adapted to the genius of the times 7 and the rational Christian who might have been contented with the light yoke and easy burden of Jesus and his apostles was justly offended that the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God the first article of natural and revealed religion </s>
<s> Their belief and their trust was in the Father of Christ of the human soul and of the invisible world </s>
<s> But they likewise held the eternity of matter a stubborn and rebellious substance the origin of a second principle of an active being who has created this visible world and exercises his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin </s>
<s> 8 The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the two principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the East from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various swarms of the Gnostics </s>
<s> A thousand shades may be devised in the nature and character of Ahriman from a rival god to a subordinate daemon from passion and frailty to pure and perfect malevolence but in spite of our efforts the goodness and the power of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the line and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal proportion from the other </s>

<s> have labored to explore and discriminate the various systems of the Gnostics on the subject of the two principles.] The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the number of his disciples the secret recompense of spiritual ambition </s>
<s> The remnant of the Gnostic sects and especially the Manichaeans of Armenia were united under his standard many Catholics were converted or seduced by his arguments and he preached with success in the regions of Pontus 10 and Cappadocia which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster </s>
<s> The Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their Scriptural names by the modest title of Fellowpilgrims by the austerity of their lives their zeal or knowledge and the credit of some extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit </s>
<s> But they were incapable of desiring or at least of obtaining the wealth and honors of the Catholic prelacy such anti Christian pride they bitterly censured and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned as an institution of the Jewish synagogue </s>
<s> The new sect was loosely spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward of the Euphrates six of their principal congregations represented the churches to which St. Paul had addressed his epistles and their founder chose his residence in the neighborhood of Colonia 11 in the same district of Pontus which had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona 12 and the miracles of Gregory </s>
<s> 13 After a mission of twentyseven years Sylvanus who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs fell a sacrifice to Roman persecution </s>
<s> The laws of the pious emperors which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets the books and the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans the books were delivered to the flames and all who should presume to secrete such writings or to profess such opinions were devoted to an ignominious death </s>
<s> 14 A Greek minister armed with legal and military powers appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd and to reclaim if possible the lost sheep </s>
<s> By a refinement of cruelty Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of his disciples who were commanded as the price of their pardon and the proof of their repentance to massacre their spiritual father </s>
<s> They turned aside from the impious office the stones dropped from their filial hands and of the whole number only one executioner could be found a new David as he is styled by the Catholics who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy </s>
<s> This apostate Justin was his name again deceived and betrayed his unsuspecting brethren and a new conformity to the acts of St. Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon like the apostle he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute renounced his honors and fortunes and required among the Paulicians the fame of a missionary and a martyr </s>
<s> They were not ambitious of martyrdom 15 but in a calamitous period of one hundred and fifty years their patience sustained whatever zeal could inflict and power was insufficient to eradicate the obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason </s>
<s> From the blood and ashes of the first victims a succession of teachers and congregations repeatedly arose amidst their foreign hostilities they found leisure for domestic quarrels they preached they disputed they suffered and the virtues the apparent virtues of Sergius in a pilgrimage of thirtythree years are reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians </s>
<s> 16 The native cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated by a pious cause and he vainly hoped to extinguish in a single conflagration the name and memory of the Paulicians </s>
<s> By their primitive simplicity their abhorrence of popular superstition the Iconoclast princes might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines but they themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks and they chose to be the tyrants lest they should be accused as the accomplices of the Manichaeans </s>
<s> Such a reproach has sullied the clemency of Nicephorus who relaxed in their favor the severity of the penal statutes nor will his character sustain the honor of a more liberal motive </s>
<s> The feeble Michael the First the rigid Leo the Armenian were foremost in the race of persecution but the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion of Theodora who restored the images to the Oriental church </s>
<s> Her inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that in a short reign one hundred thousand Paulicians were extirpated by the sword the gibbet or the flames </s>
<s> Her guilt or merit has perhaps been stretched beyond the measure of truth but if the account be allowed it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts were punished under a more odious name and that some who were driven from the church unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy </s>

<s> The cathedral of Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules and horses and the Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt and abhorrence of images and relics </s>

<s> The emperor Basil the Macedonian was reduced to sue for peace to offer a ransom for the captives and to request in the language of moderation and charity that Chrysocheir would spare his fellowChristians and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and silk garments </s>

<s> Part II </s>
<s> About the middle of the eight century Constantine surnamed Copronymus by the worshippers of images had made an expedition into Armenia and found in the cities of Melitene and Theodosiopolis a great number of Paulicians his kindred heretics </s>
<s> As a favor or punishment he transplanted them from the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and Thrace and by this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in Europe </s>
<s> 21 If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled with the promiscuous mass those of the country struck a deep root in a foreign soil </s>
<s> The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the storms of persecution maintained a secret correspondence with their Armenian brethren and gave aid and comfort to their preachers who solicited not without success the infant faith of the Bulgarians </s>
<s> 22 In the tenth century they were restored and multiplied by a more powerful colony which John Zimisces 23 transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount Haemus </s>
<s> The Oriental clergy who would have preferred the destruction impatiently sighed for the absence of the Manichaeans the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their valor their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with mischief but on the side of the Danube against the Barbarians of Scythia their service might be useful and their loss would be desirable </s>
<s> Their exile in a distant land was softened by a free toleration the Paulicians held the city of Philippopolis and the keys of Thrace the Catholics were their subjects the Jacobite emigrants their associates they occupied a line of villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus and many native Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy </s>
<s> As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the empire and the courage of these dogs ever greedy of war ever thirsty of human blood is noticed with astonishment and almost with reproach by the pusillanimous Greeks </s>
<s> The same spirit rendered them arrogant and contumacious they were easily provoked by caprice or injury and their privileges were often violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy </s>
<s> In the midst of the Norman war two thousand five hundred Manichaeans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus 24 and retired to their native homes </s>
<s> He dissembled till the moment of revenge invited the chiefs to a friendly conference and punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment confiscation and baptism </s>
<s> In an interval of peace the emperor undertook the pious office of reconciling them to the church and state his winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis and the thirteenth apostle as he is styled by his pious daughter consumed whole days and nights in theological controversy </s>
<s> His arguments were fortified their obstinacy was melted by the honors and rewards which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes and a new city surrounded with gardens enriched with immunities and dignified with his own name was founded by Alexius for the residence of his vulgar converts </s>
<s> The important station of Philippopolis was wrested from their hands the contumacious leaders were secured in a dungeon or banished from their country and their lives were spared by the prudence rather than the mercy of an emperor at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt alive before the church of St. Sophia </s>
<s> 25 But the proud hope of eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by the invincible zeal of the Paulicians who ceased to dissemble or refused to obey </s>
<s> After the departure and death of Alexius they soon resumed their civil and religious laws </s>
<s> In the beginning of the thirteenth century their pope or primate a manifest corruption resided on the confines of Bulgaria Croatia and Dalmatia and governed by his vicars the filial congregations of Italy and France </s>
<s> 26 From that aera a minute scrutiny might prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition </s>
<s> At the end of the last age the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount Haemus where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government </s>
<s> The modern Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin and their religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross and the practice of bloody sacrifice which some captives have imported from the wilds of Tartary </s>

<s> The favor and success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth centuries must be imputed to the strong though secret discontent which armed the most pious Christians against the church of Rome </s>
<s> Her avarice was oppressive her despotism odious less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the worship of saints and images her innovations were more rapid and scandalous she had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of transubstantiation the lives of the Latin clergy were more corrupt and the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of the apostles if they were compared with the lordly prelates who wielded by turns the crosier the sceptre and the sword </s>
<s> Three different roads might introduce the Paulicians into the heart of Europe </s>
<s> After the conversion of Hungary the pilgrims who visited Jerusalem might safely follow the course of the Danube in their journey and return they passed through Philippopolis and the sectaries disguising their name and heresy might accompany the French or German caravans to their respective countries </s>
<s> The trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the Adriatic and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of every climate and religion </s>
<s> Under the Byzantine standard the Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy and Sicily in peace and war they freely conversed with strangers and natives and their opinions were silently propagated in Rome Milan and the kingdoms beyond the Alps </s>
<s> 28 It was soon discovered that many thousand Catholics of every rank and of either sex had embraced the Manichaean heresy and the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the first act and signal of persecution </s>
<s> The Bulgarians 29 a name so innocent in its origin so odious in its application spread their branches over the face of Europe </s>

<s> But he adds that the two nations of Bulgarians and Hungarians were superior to their brethren and similar to each other in the improvements however rude of their discipline and government their visible likeness determines Leo to confound his friends and enemies in one common description and the picture may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries of the tenth century </s>
<s> Except the merit and fame of military prowess all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to these Barbarians whose native fierceness was stimulated by the consciousness of numbers and freedom </s>
<s> The tents of the Hungarians were of leather their garments of fur they shaved their hair and scarified their faces in speech they were slow in action prompt in treaty perfidious and they shared the common reproach of Barbarians too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn engagements </s>
<s> Their simplicity has been praised yet they abstained only from the luxury they had never known whatever they saw they coveted their desires were insatiate and their sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine </s>
<s> By the definition of a pastoral nation I have recalled a long description of the economy the warfare and the government that prevail in that state of society I may add that to fishing as well as to the chase the Hungarians were indebted for a part of their subsistence and since they seldom cultivated the ground they must at least in their new settlements have sometimes practised a slight and unskilful husbandry </s>
<s> In their emigrations perhaps in their expeditions the host was accompanied by thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of formidable dust and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of milk and animal food </s>
<s> A plentiful command of forage was the first care of the general and if the flocks and herds were secure of their pastures the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger and fatigue </s>
<s> The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise had not a still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the enemy </s>
<s> After some experience of the Roman tactics they adopted the use of the sword and spear the helmet of the soldier and the iron breastplate of his steed but their native and deadly weapon was the Tartar bow from the earliest infancy their children and servants were exercised in the double science of archery and horsemanship their arm was strong their aim was sure and in the most rapid career they were taught to throw themselves backwards and to shoot a volley of arrows into the air </s>
<s> In open combat in secret ambush in flight or pursuit they were equally formidable an appearance of order was maintained in the foremost ranks but their charge was driven forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds </s>
<s> They pursued headlong and rash with loosened reins and horrific outcries but if they fled with real or dissembled fear the ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution </s>
<s> In the abuse of victory they astonished Europe yet smarting from the wounds of the Saracen and the Dane mercy they rarely asked and more rarely bestowed both sexes were accused is equally inaccessible to pity and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the popular tale that they drank the blood and feasted on the hearts of the slain </s>
<s> Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those principles of justice and humanity which nature has implanted in every bosom </s>
<s> The license of public and private injuries was restrained by laws and punishments and in the security of an open camp theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence </s>

<s> During the life of Arnulph the Hungarians were checked by gratitude or fear but in the infancy of his son Lewis they discovered and invaded Bavaria and such was their Scythian speed that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped and consumed </s>
<s> In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians maintained their advantage till the seventh hour of the day they were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the Turkish cavalry </s>
<s> The conflagration spread over the provinces of Bavaria Swabia and Franconia and the Hungarians 31 promoted the reign of anarchy by forcing the stoutest barons to discipline their vassals and fortify their castles </s>
<s> The origin of walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period nor could any distance be secure against an enemy who almost at the same instant laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall and the city of Bremen on the shores of the northern ocean </s>

<s> I have neither power nor inclination to follow the Hungarians beyond the Rhine but I must observe with surprise that the southern provinces of France were blasted by the tempest and that Spain behind her Pyrenees was astonished at the approach of these formidable strangers </s>
<s> 32 The vicinity of Italy had tempted their early inroads but from their camp on the Brenta they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and populousness of the new discovered country </s>

<s> Among the cities of the West the royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor and the preeminence of Rome itself was only derived from the relics of the apostles </s>
<s> The Hungarians appeared Pavia was in flames fortythree churches were consumed and after the massacre of the people they spared about two hundred wretches who had gathered some bushels of gold and silver a vague exaggeration from the smoking ruins of their country </s>

<s> But the saints were deaf or inexorable and the torrent rolled forwards till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria </s>
<s> 33 A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each Italian subject and ten bushels of silver were poured forth in the Turkish camp </s>
<s> But falsehood is the natural antagonist of violence and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of the assessment and the standard of the metal </s>
<s> On the side of the East the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the equal arms of the Bulgarians whose faith forbade an alliance with the Pagans and whose situation formed the barrier of the Byzantine empire </s>
<s> The barrier was overturned the emperor of Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks and one of their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battleaxe into the golden gate </s>
<s> The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the assault but the Hungarians might boast in their retreat that they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the majesty of the Caesars </s>
<s> 34 The remote and rapid operations of the same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the Turks but their courage is most deserving of praise since a light troop of three or four hundred horse would often attempt and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica and Constantinople </s>

<s> 49 The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious province of Wolodomir or Moscow and if they were confined on that side by the hordes of the East their western frontier in those early days was enlarged to the Baltic Sea and the country of the Prussians </s>
<s> Their northern reign ascended above the sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean regions which fancy had peopled with monsters or clouded with eternal darkness </s>
<s> To the south they followed the course of the Borysthenes and approached with that river the neighborhood of the Euxine Sea </s>
<s> The tribes that dwelt or wandered in this ample circuit were obedient to the same conqueror and insensibly blended into the same nation </s>
<s> The language of Russia is a dialect of the Sclavonian but in the tenth century these two modes of speech were different from each other and as the Sclavonian prevailed in the South it may be presumed that the original Russians of the North the primitive subjects of the Varangian chief were a portion of the Fennic race </s>
<s> With the emigration union or dissolution of the wandering tribes the loose and indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually shifted </s>
<s> But the most ancient map of Russia affords some places which still retain their name and position and the two capitals Novogorod 50 and Kiow 51 are coeval with the first age of the monarchy </s>
<s> Novogorod had not yet deserved the epithet of great nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League which diffused the streams of opulence and the principles of freedom </s>
<s> Kiow could not yet boast of three hundred churches an innumerable people and a degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the Caesars </s>
<s> In their origin the two cities were no more than camps or fairs the most convenient stations in which the Barbarians might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade </s>
<s> Yet even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of society a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern provinces and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the sea and land from the Baltic to the Euxine from the mouth of the Oder to the port of Constantinople </s>
<s> In the days of idolatry and barbarism the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and enriched by the Normans who had prudently secured a free mart of purchase and exchange </s>
<s> 52 From this harbor at the entrance of the Oder the corsair or merchant sailed in fortythree days to the eastern shores of the Baltic the most distant nations were intermingled and the holy groves of Curland are said to have been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold </s>
<s> 53 Between the sea and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered in the summer through a gulf a lake and a navigable river in the winter season over the hard and level surface of boundless snows </s>
<s> From the neighborhood of that city the Russians descended the streams that fall into the Borysthenes their canoes of a single tree were laden with slaves of every age furs of every species the spoil of their beehives and the hides of their cattle and the whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the magazines of Kiow </s>
<s> The month of June was the ordinary season of the departure of the fleet the timber of the canoes was framed into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats and they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes as far as the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks which traverse the bed and precipitate the waters of the river </s>
<s> At the more shallow falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels but the deeper cataracts were impassable and the mariners who dragged their vessels and their slaves six miles over land were exposed in this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert </s>
<s> 54 At the first island below the falls the Russians celebrated the festival of their escape at a second near the mouth of the river they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and more perilous voyage of the Black Sea </s>
<s> If they steered along the coast the Danube was accessible with a fair wind they could reach in thirtysix or forty hours the opposite shores of Anatolia and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the strangers of the North </s>

<s> In a period of one hundred and ninety years the Russians made four attempts to plunder the treasures of Constantinople the event was various but the motive the means and the object were the same in these naval expeditions </s>
<s> 56 The Russian traders had seen the magnificence and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars </s>
<s> A marvellous tale and a scanty supply excited the desires of their savage countrymen they envied the gifts of nature which their climate denied they coveted the works of art which they were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase the Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt in the northern isles of the ocean </s>
<s> 57 The image of their naval armaments was revived in the last century in the fleets of the Cossacks which issued from the Borysthenes to navigate the same seas for a similar purpose </s>
<s> 58 The Greek appellation of monoxyla or single canoes might justly be applied to the bottom of their vessels </s>
<s> It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or willow but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and continued on either side with planks till it attained the length of sixty and the height of about twelve feet </s>
<s> These boats were built without a deck but with two rudders and a mast to move with sails and oars and to contain from forty to seventy men with their arms and provisions of fresh water and salt fish </s>
<s> The first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred boats but when the national force was exerted they might arm against Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels </s>
<s> Their fleet was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon but it was magnified in the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real proportion of its strength and numbers </s>
<s> Had the Greek emperors been endowed with foresight to discern and vigor to prevent perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of the Borysthenes </s>
<s> Their indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia to the calamities of a piratical war which after an interval of six hundred years again infested the Euxine but as long as the capital was respected the sufferings of a distant province escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian </s>
<s> The storm which had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond at length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace a strait of fifteen miles in which the rude vessels of the Russians might have been stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary </s>
<s> In their first enterprise 59 under the princes of Kiow they passed without opposition and occupied the port of Constantinople in the absence of the emperor Michael the son of Theophilus </s>
<s> Through a crowd of perils he landed at the palacestairs and immediately repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary </s>
<s> 60 By the advice of the patriarch her garment a precious relic was drawn from the sanctuary and dipped in the sea and a seasonable tempest which determined the retreat of the Russians was devoutly ascribed to the mother of God </s>
<s> 61 The silence of the Greeks may inspire some doubt of the truth or at least of the importance of the second attempt by Oleg the guardian of the sons of Ruric </s>
<s> 62 A strong barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus they were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the isthmus and this simple operation is described in the national chronicles as if the Russian fleet had sailed over dry land with a brisk and favorable gale </s>
<s> The leader of the third armament Igor the son of Ruric had chosen a moment of weakness and decay when the naval powers of the empire were employed against the Saracens </s>
<s> But if courage be not wanting the instruments of defence are seldom deficient </s>
<s> Fifteen broken and decayed galleys were boldly launched against the enemy but instead of the single tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow the sides and stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid combustible </s>
<s> The engineers were dexterous the weather was propitious many thousand Russians who chose rather to be drowned than burnt leaped into the sea and those who escaped to the Thracian shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and soldiers </s>
<s> Yet one third of the canoes escaped into shallow water and the next spring Igor was again prepared to retrieve his disgrace and claim his revenge </s>
<s> 63 After a long peace Jaroslaus the great grandson of Igor resumed the same project of a naval invasion </s>
<s> A fleet under the command of his son was repulsed at the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial flames </s>

<s> The division of this flourishing state produced the rival principalities of Benevento Salerno and Capua and the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance </s>
<s> During a calamitous period of two hundred years Italy was exposed to a repetition of wounds which the invaders were not capable of healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest </s>
<s> Their frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of Palermo and were entertained with too much indulgence by the Christians of Naples the more formidable fleets were prepared on the African coast and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect </s>
<s> In the revolution of human events a new ambuscade was concealed in the Caudine Forks the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second time with the blood of the Africans and the sovereign of Rome again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum </s>
<s> A colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari which commands the entrance of the Adriatic Gulf and their impartial depredations provoked the resentment and conciliated the union of the two emperors </s>
<s> An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the Macedonian the first of his race and Lewis the greatgrandson of Charlemagne 3 and each party supplied the deficiencies of his associate </s>
<s> It would have been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an Italian campaign and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if his superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf </s>
<s> The fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks and by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks and after a defence of four years the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis who commanded in person the operations of the siege </s>
<s> This important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East and West but their recent amity was soon imbittered by the mutual complaints of jealousy and pride </s>
<s> The Greeks assumed as their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph extolled the greatness of their powers and affected to deride the intemperance and sloth of the handful of Barbarians who appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince </s>

<s> Your armies were indeed as numerous as a cloud of summer locusts who darken the day flap their wings and after a short flight tumble weary and breathless to the ground </s>
<s> Like them ye sunk after a feeble effort ye were vanquished by your own cowardice and withdrew from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian subjects of the Sclavonian coast </s>
<s> We were few in number and why were we few </s>
<s> Because after a tedious expectation of your arrival I had dismissed my host and retained only a chosen band of warriors to continue the blockade of the city </s>

<s> At the siege of Salerno a Mussulman chief spread his couch on the communiontable and on that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a Christian nun </s>

<s> 11 A fearless citizen dropped from the walls passed the intrenchments accomplished his commission and fell into the hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the welcome news </s>
<s> They commanded him to assist their enterprise and deceive his countrymen with the assurance that wealth and honors should be the reward of his falsehood and that his sincerity would be punished with immediate death </s>
<s> He affected to yield but as soon as he was conducted within hearing of the Christians on the rampart Friends and brethren he cried with a loud voice be bold and patient maintain the city your sovereign is informed of your distress and your deliverers are at hand </s>
<s> I know my doom and commit my wife and children to your gratitude </s>
<s> The rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence and the selfdevoted patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears </s>

<s> 12 3 </s>
<s> The recital of a third incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war </s>
<s> Theobald marquis of Camerino and Spoleto 13 supported the rebels of Beneventum and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible in that age with the character of a hero </s>
<s> His captives of the Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy and the outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest that he wished to present the emperor with a supply of eunuchs the most precious ornaments of the Byzantine court </s>
<s> The garrison of a castle had been defeated in a sally and the prisoners were sentenced to the customary operation </s>
<s> But the sacrifice was disturbed by the intrusion of a frantic female who with bleeding cheeks dishevelled hair and importunate clamors compelled the marquis to listen to her complaint </s>
<s> Is it thus she cried 'ye magnanimous heroes that ye wage war against women against women who have never injured ye and whose only arms are the distaff and the loom </s>
<s> Theobald denied the charge and protested that since the Amazons he had never heard of a female war </s>
<s> And how she furiously exclaimed can you attack us more directly how can you wound us in a more vital part than by robbing our husbands of what we most dearly cherish the source of our joys and the hope of our posterity </s>
<s> The plunder of our flocks and herds I have endured without a murmur but this fatal injury this irreparable loss subdues my patience and calls aloud on the justice of heaven and earth </s>
<s> A general laugh applauded her eloquence the savage Franks inaccessible to pity were moved by her ridiculous yet rational despair and with the deliverance of the captives she obtained the restitution of her effects </s>
<s> As she returned in triumph to the castle she was overtaken by a messenger to inquire in the name of Theobald what punishment should be inflicted on her husband were he again taken in arms </s>
<s> Should such she answered without hesitation be his guilt and misfortune he has eyes and a nose and hands and feet </s>

<s> 39 His genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of private nobility </s>
<s> 40 He sprang from a race of valvassors or bannerets of the diocese of Coutances in the Lower Normandy the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat his father Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke and his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights </s>
<s> Two marriages of a rank not unworthy of his own made him the father of twelve sons who were educated at home by the impartial tenderness of his second wife </s>
<s> But a narrow patrimony was insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny they saw around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord and resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance </s>
<s> Two only remained to perpetuate the race and cherish their father's age their ten brothers as they successfully attained the vigor of manhood departed from the castle passed the Alps and joined the Apulian camp of the Normans </s>
<s> The elder were prompted by native spirit their success encouraged their younger brethren and the three first in seniority William Drogo and Humphrey deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the new republic </s>
<s> Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second marriage and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman </s>
<s> His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness and to the decline of life he maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form </s>
<s> His complexion was ruddy his shoulders were broad his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen color his eyes sparkled with fire and his voice like that of Achilles could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle </s>
<s> In the ruder ages of chivalry such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historians they may observe that Robert at once and with equal dexterity could wield in the right hand his sword his lance in the left that in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the warriors of the two armies </s>
<s> 41 His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth in the pursuit of greatness he was never arrested by the scruples of justice and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity though not insensible of fame the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage </s>
<s> The surname of Guiscard 42 was applied to this master of political wisdom which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero </s>
<s> Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness in his highest fortune he was accessible and courteous to his fellowsoldiers and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country </s>
<s> He grasped with a rapacious that he might distribute with a liberal hand his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality the gain of a merchant was not below his attention and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty to force a discovery of their secret treasure </s>
<s> According to the Greeks he departed from Normandy with only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot yet even this allowance appears too bountiful the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim and his first military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy </s>
<s> His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber </s>
<s> To surprise a castle or a convent to ensnare a wealthy citizen to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food were the obscure labors which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body </s>

<s> With an increase of authority and of force he resumed the conquest of Calabria and soon aspired to a rank that should raise him forever above the heads of his equals </s>
<s> By some acts of rapine or sacrilege he had incurred a papal excommunication but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their mutual prejudice that the Normans were the faithful champions of the Holy See and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince than the caprice of an aristocracy </s>
<s> A synod of one hundred bishops was convened at Melphi and the count interrupted an important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees of the Roman pontiff </s>

<s> 44 This apostolic sanction might justify his arms but the obedience of a free and victorious people could not be transferred without their consent and Guiscard dissembled his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by the conquest of Consenza and Reggio </s>
<s> In the hour of triumph he assembled his troops and solicited the Normans to confirm by their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ the soldiers hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke and the counts his former equals pronounced the oath of fidelity with hollow smiles and secret indignation </s>
<s> After this inauguration Robert styled himself By the grace of God and St. Peter duke of Apulia Calabria and hereafter of Sicily and it was the labor of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty appellations </s>
<s> Such sardy progress in a narrow space may seem unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the nation but the Normans were few in number their resources were scanty their service was voluntary and precarious </s>
<s> The bravest designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of his parliament of barons the twelve counts of popular election conspired against his authority and against their perfidious uncle the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge </s>
<s> By his policy and vigor Guiscard discovered their plots suppressed their rebellions and punished the guilty with death or exile but in these domestic feuds his years and the national strength were unprofitably consumed </s>

<s> So scanty was his allowance for himself and forty followers that he descended from conquest to robbery and from robbery to domestic theft and so loose were the notions of property that by his own historian at his special command he is accused of stealing horses from a stable at Melphi </s>

<s> In his old age he related with pleasure that by the distress of the siege himself and the countess his wife had been reduced to a single cloak or mantle which they wore alternately that in a sally his horse had been slain and he was dragged away by the Saracens but that he owed his rescue to his good sword and had retreated with his saddle on his back lest the meanest trophy might be left in the hands of the miscreants </s>

<s> 59 From his first wife the partner of his humble fortune he had been divorced under the pretence of consanguinity and her son Bohemond was destined to imitate rather than to succeed his illustrious father </s>
<s> The second wife of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno the Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger their five daughters were given in honorable nuptials 60 and one of them was betrothed in a tender age to Constantine a beautiful youth the son and heir of the emperor Michael </s>
<s> 61 But the throne of Constantinople was shaken by a revolution the Imperial family of Ducas was confined to the palace or the cloister and Robert deplored and resented the disgrace of his daughter and the expulsion of his ally </s>
<s> A Greek who styled himself the father of Constantine soon appeared at Salerno and related the adventures of his fall and flight </s>
<s> That unfortunate friend was acknowledged by the duke and adorned with the pomp and titles of Imperial dignity in his triumphal progress through Apulia and Calabria Michael 62 was saluted with the tears and acclamations of the people and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted the bishops to preach and the Catholics to fight in the pious work of his restoration </s>
<s> His conversations with Robert were frequent and familiar and their mutual promises were justified by the valor of the Normans and the treasures of the East </s>
<s> Yet this Michael by the confession of the Greeks and Latins was a pageant and an impostor a monk who had fled from his convent or a domestic who had served in the palace </s>
<s> The fraud had been contrived by the subtle Guiscard and he trusted that after this pretender had given a decent color to his arms he would sink at the nod of the conqueror into his primitive obscurity </s>
<s> But victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of the Greeks and the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to their credulity the Norman veterans wished to enjoy the harvest of their toils and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the known and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition </s>
<s> In his new levies Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises the terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority and some acts of violence might justify the reproach that age and infancy were pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting prince </s>
<s> After two years' incessant preparations the land and naval forces were assembled at Otranto at the heel or extreme promontory of Italy and Robert was accompanied by his wife who fought by his side his son Bohemond and the representative of the emperor Michael </s>

<s> They had wept during the tempest they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the Venetians who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of the Byzantine court </s>
<s> The first day's action was not disadvantageous to Bohemond a beardless youth 68 who led the naval powers of his father </s>
<s> All night the galleys of the republic lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent and the victory of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their evolutions the station of their archers the weight of their javelins and the borrowed aid of the Greek fire </s>
<s> The Apulian and Ragusian vessels fled to the shore several were cut from their cables and dragged away by the conqueror and a sally from the town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the Norman duke </s>
<s> A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo and as soon as the besiegers had lost the command of the sea the islands and maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and provision </s>
<s> That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential disease five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death and the list of burials if all could obtain a decent burial amounted to ten thousand persons </s>

<s> Their youthful ardor might animate the multitude but their love of pleasure and contempt of subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief and their importunate clamors for speedy and decisive action disconcerted the prudence of Alexius who might have surrounded and starved the besieging army </s>
<s> The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad comparison of the past and present limits of the Roman world the raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror and the garrisons of Anatolia or Asia Minor had been purchased by the evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the Turks </s>

<s> To the brave and noble Palaeologus his lieutenant the Greek monarch intrusted a fleet and army the siege of Bari was his first exploit and in every operation gold as well as steel was the instrument of victory </s>
<s> Salerno and some places along the western coast maintained their fidelity to the Norman king but he lost in two campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions and the modest emperor disdaining all flattery and falsehood was content with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of Apulia and Calabria whose names and titles were inscribed on all the walls of the palace </s>
<s> The prejudices of the Latins were gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of the German Caesars 113 but the successor of Constantine soon renounced this ignominious pretence claimed the indefeasible dominion of Italy and professed his design of chasing the Barbarians beyond the Alps </s>
<s> By the artful speeches liberal gifts and unbounded promises of their Eastern ally the free cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle against the despotism of Frederic Barbarossa the walls of Milan were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel and he poured says the historian a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona whose attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of the Venetians </s>
<s> 114 The situation and trade of Ancona rendered it an important garrison in the heart of Italy it was twice besieged by the arms of Frederic the imperial forces were twice repulsed by the spirit of freedom that spirit was animated by the ambassador of Constantinople and the most intrepid patriots the most faithful servants were rewarded by the wealth and honors of the Byzantine court </s>
<s> 115 The pride of Manuel disdained and rejected a Barbarian colleague his ambition was excited by the hope of stripping the purple from the German usurpers and of establishing in the West as in the East his lawful title of sole emperor of the Romans </s>
<s> With this view he solicited the alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome </s>
<s> Several of the nobles embraced the cause of the Greek monarch the splendid nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of that powerful family 116 and his royal standard or image was entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis </s>

<s> While Apulia and Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance a swarm of these northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia their princes of the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire from Samarcand to the confines of Greece and Egypt and the Turks have maintained their dominion in Asia Minor till the victorious crescent has been planted on the dome of St. Sophia </s>
<s> One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud 1 the Gaznevide who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia one thousand years after the birth of Christ </s>
<s> His father Sebectagi was the slave of the slave of the slave of the commander of the faithful </s>
<s> But in this descent of servitude the first degree was merely titular since it was filled by the sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan who still paid a nominal allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad </s>
<s> The second rank was that of a minister of state a lieutenant of the Samanides 2 who broke by his revolt the bonds of political slavery </s>
<s> But the third step was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that rebel from which Sebectagi by his courage and dexterity ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of Gazna 3 as the soninlaw and successor of his grateful master </s>
<s> The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected and at last overthrown by their servants and in the public disorders the fortune of Mahmud continually increased </s>
<s> From him the title of Sultan 4 was first invented and his kingdom was enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighborhood of Ispahan from the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus </s>
<s> But the principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan </s>
<s> In this foreign narrative I may not consume a page and a volume would scarcely suffice to recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions </s>
<s> Never was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the seasons the height of the mountains the breadth of the rivers the barrenness of the desert the multitudes of the enemy or the formidable array of their elephants of war </s>
<s> 5 The sultan of Gazna surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander after a march of three months over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet he reached the famous city of Kinnoge 6 on the Upper Ganges and in a naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus he fought and vanquished four thousand boats of the natives </s>
<s> Delhi Lahor and Multan were compelled to open their gates the fertile kingdom of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay and his avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean </s>
<s> On the payment of a tribute the rajahs preserved their dominions the people their lives and fortunes but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous Mussulman was cruel and inexorable many hundred temples or pagodas were levelled with the ground many thousand idols were demolished and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed </s>
<s> The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guzarat in the neighborhood of Diu one of the last remaining possessions of the Portuguese </s>
<s> 7 It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand villages two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service of the Deity whom they washed each morning and evening in water from the distant Ganges the subordinate ministers consisted of three hundred musicians three hundred barbers and five hundred dancing girls conspicuous for their birth or beauty </s>
<s> Three sides of the temple were protected by the ocean the narrow isthmus was fortified by a natural or artificial precipice and the city and adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics </s>
<s> They confessed the sins and the punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi but if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy precincts he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the divine vengeance </s>
<s> By this challenge the faith of Mahmud was animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian deity </s>
<s> Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the spear of the Moslems the walls were scaled the sanctuary was profaned and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the head of the idol </s>
<s> The trembling Brahmins are said to have offered ten millions sterling for his ransom and it was urged by the wisest counsellors that the destruction of a stone image would not change the hearts of the Gentoos and that such a sum might be dedicated to the relief of the true believers </s>
<s> Your reasons replied the sultan are specious and strong but never in the eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of idols </s>
<s> He repeated his blows and a treasure of pearls and rubies concealed in the belly of the statue explained in some degree the devout prodigality of the Brahmins </s>
<s> The fragments of the idol were distributed to Gazna Mecca and Medina </s>

<s> It does not seem to have been the vanity of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion </s>
<s> The curious point in the new faith is that Hamza the son of Ali the real founder of the Unitarian religion such is its boastful title was content to take a secondary part </s>
<s> While Hakem was God the one Supreme the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence </s>
<s> It was not in his divine character that Hakem hated the Jews and Christians but in that of a Mahometan bigot which he displayed in the earlier years of his reign </s>

<s> His stature was small his appearance contemptible but his eye was keen and lively and he possessed that vehemence of speech which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul </s>

<s> But the name and nature of a holy war demands a more rigorous scrutiny nor can we hastily believe that the servants of the Prince of Peace would unsheathe the sword of destruction unless the motive were pure the quarrel legitimate and the necessity inevitable </s>
<s> The policy of an action may be determined from the tardy lessons of experience but before we act our conscience should be satisfied of the justice and propriety of our enterprise </s>
<s> In the age of the crusades the Christians both of the East and West were persuaded of their lawfulness and merit their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of Scripture and rhetoric but they seem to insist on the right of natural and religious defence their peculiar title to the Holy Land and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes </s>
<s> 20 I </s>
<s> The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and spiritual allies it depends on the existence of danger and that danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the malice and the power of our enemies </s>
<s> A pernicious tenet has been imputed to the Mahometans the duty of extirpating all other religions by the sword </s>
<s> This charge of ignorance and bigotry is refuted by the Koran by the history of the Mussulman conquerors and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian worship </s>
<s> But it cannot be denied that the Oriental churches are depressed under their iron yoke that in peace and war they assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire and that in their orthodox creed the unbelieving nations are continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty </s>
<s> In the eleventh century the victorious arms of the Turks presented a real and urgent apprehension of these losses </s>
<s> They had subdued in less than thirty years the kingdoms of Asia as far as Jerusalem and the Hellespont and the Greek empire tottered on the verge of destruction </s>
<s> Besides an honest sympathy for their brethren the Latins had a right and interest in the support of Constantinople the most important barrier of the West and the privilege of defence must reach to prevent as well as to repel an impending assault </s>
<s> But this salutary purpose might have been accomplished by a moderate succor and our calmer reason must disclaim the innumerable hosts and remote operations which overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe </s>
<s> [Footnote 20 If the reader will turn to the first scene of the First Part of Henry the Fourth he will see in the text of Shakespeare the natural feelings of enthusiasm and in the notes of Dr. Johnson the workings of a bigoted though vigorous mind greedy of every pretence to hate and persecute those who dissent from his creed.] [Footnote The manner in which the war was conducted surely has little relation to the abstract question of the justice or injustice of the war </s>
<s> The most just and necessary war may be conducted with the most prodigal waste of human life and the wildest fanaticism the most unjust with the coolest moderation and consummate generalship </s>
<s> The question is whether the liberties and religion of Europe were in danger from the aggressions of Mahometanism </s>
<s> If so it is difficult to limit the right though it may be proper to question the wisdom of overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole continent and repelling if possible the invading conqueror into his native deserts </s>
<s> The crusades are monuments of human folly </s>
<s> but to which of the more regular wars civilized </s>
<s> Europe waged for personal ambition or national jealousy will our calmer reason appeal as monuments either of human justice or human wisdom </s>

<s> Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the Latins and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the conquest of that distant and narrow province </s>
<s> The Christians affirmed that their inalienable title to the promised land had been sealed by the blood of their divine Savior it was their right and duty to rescue their inheritance from the unjust possessors who profaned his sepulchre and oppressed the pilgrimage of his disciples </s>
<s> Vainly would it be alleged that the preeminence of Jerusalem and the sanctity of Palestine have been abolished with the Mosaic law that the God of the Christians is not a local deity and that the recovery of Bethlem or Calvary his cradle or his tomb will not atone for the violation of the moral precepts of the gospel </s>
<s> Such arguments glance aside from the leaden shield of superstition and the religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred ground of mystery and miracle </s>
<s> III </s>

<s> 223 261 contains an accurate and rational view of the causes and effects of the crusades.] As the manners of the Christians were relaxed their discipline of penance 22 was enforced and with the multiplication of sins the remedies were multiplied </s>
<s> In the primitive church a voluntary and open confession prepared the work of atonement </s>
<s> In the middle ages the bishops and priests interrogated the criminal compelled him to account for his thoughts words and actions and prescribed the terms of his reconciliation with God </s>
<s> But as this discretionary power might alternately be abused by indulgence and tyranny a rule of discipline was framed to inform and regulate the spiritual judges </s>
<s> This mode of legislation was invented by the Greeks their penitentials 23 were translated or imitated in the Latin church and in the time of Charlemagne the clergy of every diocese were provided with a code which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of the vulgar </s>
<s> In this dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments each case was supposed each difference was remarked by the experience or penetration of the monks some sins are enumerated which innocence could not have suspected and others which reason cannot believe and the more ordinary offences of fornication and adultery of perjury and sacrilege of rapine and murder were expiated by a penance which according to the various circumstances was prolonged from forty days to seven years </s>
<s> During this term of mortification the patient was healed the criminal was absolved by a salutary regimen of fasts and prayers the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and remorse and he humbly abstained from all the business and pleasure of social life </s>
<s> But the rigid execution of these laws would have depopulated the palace the camp and the city the Barbarians of the West believed and trembled but nature often rebelled against principle and the magistrate labored without effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest </s>
<s> A literal accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable the guilt of adultery was multiplied by daily repetition that of homicide might involve the massacre of a whole people each act was separately numbered and in those times of anarchy and vice a modest sinner might easily incur a debt of three hundred years </s>
<s> His insolvency was relieved by a commutation or indulgence a year of penance was appreciated at twentysix solidi 24 of silver about four pounds sterling for the rich at three solidi or nine shillings for the indigent and these alms were soon appropriated to the use of the church which derived from the redemption of sins an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion </s>
<s> A debt of three hundred years or twelve hundred pounds was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune the scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of land and the princely donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are expressly given for the remedy of their soul </s>
<s> It is a maxim of the civil law that whosoever cannot pay with his purse must pay with his body and the practice of flagellation was adopted by the monks a cheap though painful equivalent </s>
<s> By a fantastic arithmetic a year of penance was taxed at three thousand lashes 25 and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit St. Dominic of the iron Cuirass 26 that in six days he could discharge an entire century by a whipping of three hundred thousand stripes </s>
<s> His example was followed by many penitents of both sexes and as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted a sturdy disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his benefactors </s>
<s> 27 These compensations of the purse and the person introduced in the eleventh century a more honorable mode of satisfaction </s>
<s> The merit of military service against the Saracens of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors of Urban the Second </s>
<s> In the council of Clermont that pope proclaimed a plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of the cross the absolution of all their sins and a full receipt for all that might be due of canonical penance </s>
<s> 28 The cold philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression that was made on a sinful and fanatic world </s>
<s> At the voice of their pastor the robber the incendiary the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination </s>
<s> None were pure none were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin and those who were the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their pious courage </s>
<s> If they fell the spirit of the Latin clergy did not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom 29 and should they survive they could expect without impatience the delay and increase of their heavenly reward </s>
<s> They offered their blood to the Son of God who had laid down his life for their salvation they took up the cross and entered with confidence into the way of the Lord </s>
<s> His providence would watch over their safety perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the difficulties of their holy enterprise </s>
<s> The cloud and pillar of Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land </s>

<s> Part III </s>
<s> Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades a revolution had taken place among the Spaniards the Normans and the French which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe </s>
<s> The service of the infantry was degraded to the plebeians the cavalry formed the strength of the armies and the honorable name of miles or soldier was confined to the gentlemen 55 who served on horseback and were invested with the character of knighthood </s>
<s> The dukes and counts who had usurped the rights of sovereignty divided the provinces among their faithful barons the barons distributed among their vassals the fiefs or benefices of their jurisdiction and these military tenants the peers of each other and of their lord composed the noble or equestrian order which disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same species with themselves </s>
<s> The dignity of their birth was preserved by pure and equal alliances their sons alone who could produce four quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach might legally pretend to the honor of knighthood but a valiant plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword and became the father of a new race </s>
<s> A single knight could impart according to his judgment the character which he received and the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this personal distinction than from the lustre of their diadem </s>
<s> This ceremony of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and the woods of Germany 56 was in its origin simple and profane the candidate after some previous trial was invested with the sword and spurs and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight blow as an emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for him to endure </s>
<s> But superstition mingled in every public and private action of life in the holy wars it sanctified the profession of arms and the order of chivalry was assimilated in its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood </s>
<s> The bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the regeneration of baptism his sword which he offered on the altar was blessed by the ministers of religion his solemn reception was preceded by fasts and vigils and he was created a knight in the name of God of St. George and of St. Michael the archangel </s>
<s> He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession and education example and the public opinion were the inviolable guardians of his oath </s>
<s> As the champion of God and the ladies I blush to unite such discordant names he devoted himself to speak the truth to maintain the right to protect the distressed to practise courtesy a virtue less familiar to the ancients to pursue the infidels to despise the allurements of ease and safety and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the honor of his character </s>
<s> The abuse of the same spirit provoked the illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace to esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military discipline </s>
<s> Yet the benefits of this institution to refine the temper of Barbarians and to infuse some principles of faith justice and humanity were strongly felt and have been often observed </s>
<s> The asperity of national prejudice was softened and the community of religion and arms spread a similar color and generous emulation over the face of Christendom </s>
<s> Abroad in enterprise and pilgrimage at home in martial exercise the warriors of every country were perpetually associated and impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic games of classic antiquity </s>
<s> 57 Instead of the naked spectacles which corrupted the manners of the Greeks and banished from the stadium the virgins and matrons the pompous decoration of the lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and highborn beauty from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his dexterity and courage </s>
<s> The skill and strength that were exerted in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to the merit of a soldier but the tournaments as they were invented in France and eagerly adopted both in the East and West presented a lively image of the business of the field </s>
<s> The single combats the general skirmish the defence of a pass or castle were rehearsed as in actual service and the contest both in real and mimic war was decided by the superior management of the horse and lance </s>
<s> The lance was the proper and peculiar weapon of the knight his horse was of a large and heavy breed but this charger till he was roused by the approaching danger was usually led by an attendant and he quietly rode a pad or palfrey of a more easy pace </s>
<s> His helmet and sword his greaves and buckler it would be superfluous to describe but I may remark that at the period of the crusades the armor was less ponderous than in later times and that instead of a massy cuirass his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail </s>
<s> When their long lances were fixed in the rest the warriors furiously spurred their horses against the foe and the light cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the direct and impetuous weight of their charge </s>
<s> Each knight was attended to the field by his faithful squire a youth of equal birth and similar hopes he was followed by his archers and men at arms and four or five or six soldiers were computed as the furniture of a complete lance </s>
<s> In the expeditions to the neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land the duties of the feudal tenure no longer subsisted the voluntary service of the knights and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment or purchased with rewards and promises and the numbers of each squadron were measured by the power the wealth and the fame of each independent chieftain </s>
<s> They were distinguished by his banner his armorial coat and his cry of war and the most ancient families of Europe must seek in these achievements the origin and proof of their nobility </s>

<s> Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent he deposited his family and treasure in Nice retired to the mountains with fifty thousand horse and twice descended to assault the camps or quarters of the Christian besiegers which formed an imperfect circle of above six miles </s>
<s> The lofty and solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch and flanked by three hundred and seventy towers and on the verge of Christendom the Moslems were trained in arms and inflamed by religion </s>
<s> Before this city the French princes occupied their stations and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or subordination emulation prompted their valor but their valor was sullied by cruelty and their emulation degenerated into envy and civil discord </s>
<s> In the siege of Nice the arts and engines of antiquity were employed by the Latins the mine and the batteringram the tortoise and the belfrey or movable turret artificial fire and the catapult and balist the sling and the crossbow for the casting of stones and darts </s>
<s> 81 In the space of seven weeks much labor and blood were expended and some progress especially by Count Raymond was made on the side of the besiegers </s>
<s> But the Turks could protract their resistance and secure their escape as long as they were masters of the Lake 82 Ascanius which stretches several miles to the westward of the city </s>
<s> The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and industry of Alexius a great number of boats was transported on sledges from the sea to the lake they were filled with the most dexterous of his archers the flight of the sultana was intercepted Nice was invested by land and water and a Greek emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master's protection and to save themselves by a timely surrender from the rage of the savages of Europe </s>
<s> In the moment of victory or at least of hope the crusaders thirsting for blood and plunder were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed from the citadel and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important conquest </s>

<s> At the head of the Turkish emirs Baghisian a veteran chief commanded in the place his garrison was composed of six or seven thousand horse and fifteen or twenty thousand foot one hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by the sword and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks Armenians and Syrians who had been no more than fourteen years the slaves of the house of Seljuk </s>
<s> From the remains of a solid and stately wall it appears to have arisen to the height of threescore feet in the valleys and wherever less art and labor had been applied the ground was supposed to be defended by the river the morass and the mountains </s>
<s> Notwithstanding these fortifications the city had been repeatedly taken by the Persians the Arabs the Greeks and the Turks so large a circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack and in a siege that was formed about the middle of October the vigor of the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt </s>
<s> Whatever strength and valor could perform in the field was abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross in the frequent occasions of sallies of forage of the attack and defence of convoys they were often victorious and we can only complain that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the scale of probability and truth </s>

<s> Part V </s>
<s> Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and importance of her memorable sieges </s>
<s> It was not till after a long and obstinate contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obstinacy of the people the craggy ground that might supersede the necessity of fortifications and the walls and towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain </s>
<s> 105 These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades </s>
<s> The bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored the Jews their nation and worship were forever banished but nature is less changeable than man and the site of Jerusalem though somewhat softened and somewhat removed was still strong against the assaults of an enemy </s>
<s> By the experience of a recent siege and a three years' possession the Saracens of Egypt had been taught to discern and in some degree to remedy the defects of a place which religion as well as honor forbade them to resign </s>
<s> Aladin or Iftikhar the caliph's lieutenant was intrusted with the defence his policy strove to restrain the native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the holy sepulchre to animate the Moslems by the assurance of temporal and eternal rewards </s>
<s> His garrison is said to have consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabians and if he could muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants it must be confessed that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army </s>
<s> 106 Had the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins allowed them to grasp the whole circumference of four thousand yards about two English miles and a half 107 to what useful purpose should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and torrent of Cedron 108 or approach the precipices of the south and east from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear </s>
<s> Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and western sides of the city </s>
<s> Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary to the left as far as St. Stephen's gate the line of attack was continued by Tancred and the two Roberts and Count Raymond established his quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion which was no longer included within the precincts of the city </s>
<s> On the fifth day the crusaders made a general assault in the fanatic hope of battering down the walls without engines and of scaling them without ladders </s>
<s> By the dint of brutal force they burst the first barrier but they were driven back with shame and slaughter to the camp the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems and time and labor were found to be the only means of victory </s>
<s> The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days but they were forty days of calamity and anguish </s>
<s> A repetition of the old complaint of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or disorderly appetite of the Franks but the stony soil of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water the scanty springs and hasty torrents were dry in the summer season nor was the thirst of the besiegers relieved as in the city by the artificial supply of cisterns and aqueducts </s>
<s> The circumjacent country is equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building but some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders a wood near Sichem the enchanted grove of Tasso 109 was cut down the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigor and dexterity of Tancred and the engines were framed by some Genoese artists who had fortunately landed in the harbor of Jaffa </s>
<s> Two movable turrets were constructed at the expense and in the stations of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse and rolled forwards with devout labor not to the most accessible but to the most neglected parts of the fortification </s>
<s> Raymond's Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged but his colleague was more vigilant and successful the enemies were driven by his archers from the rampart the drawbridge was let down and on a Friday at three in the afternoon the day and hour of the passion Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the walls of Jerusalem </s>
<s> His example was followed on every side by the emulation of valor and about four hundred and sixty years after the conquest of Omar the holy city was rescued from the Mahometan yoke </s>
<s> In the pillage of public and private wealth the adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the first occupant and the spoils of the great mosque seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and silver rewarded the diligence and displayed the generosity of Tancred </s>
<s> A bloody sacrifice was offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify their implacable rage they indulged themselves three days in a promiscuous massacre 110 and the infection of the dead bodies produced an epidemical disease </s>
<s> After seventy thousand Moslems had been put to the sword and the harmless Jews had been burnt in their synagogue they could still reserve a multitude of captives whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare </s>
<s> Of these savage heroes of the cross Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of compassion yet we may praise the more selfish lenity of Raymond who granted a capitulation and safeconduct to the garrison of the citadel </s>
<s> 111 The holy sepulchre was now free and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow </s>
<s> Bareheaded and barefoot with contrite hearts and in an humble posture they ascended the hill of Calvary amidst the loud anthems of the clergy kissed the stone which had covered the Savior of the world and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument of their redemption </s>
<s> This union of the fiercest and most tender passions has been variously considered by two philosophers by the one 112 as easy and natural by the other 113 as absurd and incredible </s>
<s> Perhaps it is too rigorously applied to the same persons and the same hour the example of the virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions while they cleansed their bodies they purified their minds nor shall I believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre </s>

<s> Amidst the slaves of Asia unconscious of the lesson or example a model of political liberty was introduced and the laws of the French kingdom are derived from the purest source of equality and justice </s>

<s> The king in person presided in the upper court the court of the barons </s>
<s> Of these the four most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee the lord of Sidon and Caesarea and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli who perhaps with the constable and marshal 137 were in a special manner the compeers and judges of each other </s>
<s> But all the nobles who held their lands immediately of the crown were entitled and bound to attend the king's court and each baron exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of his own feudatories </s>
<s> The connection of lord and vassal was honorable and voluntary reverence was due to the benefactor protection to the dependant but they mutually pledged their faith to each other and the obligation on either side might be suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury </s>
<s> The cognizance of marriages and testaments was blended with religion and usurped by the clergy but the civil and criminal causes of the nobles the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs formed the proper occupation of the supreme court </s>
<s> Each member was the judge and guardian both of public and private rights </s>
<s> It was his duty to assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or property of a vassal the confederate peers stood forth to maintain his quarrel by word and deed </s>
<s> They boldly affirmed his innocence and his wrongs demanded the restitution of his liberty or his lands suspended after a fruitless demand their own service rescued their brother from prison and employed every weapon in his defence without offering direct violence to the person of their lord which was ever sacred in their eyes </s>
<s> 138 In their pleadings replies and rejoinders the advocates of the court were subtle and copious but the use of argument and evidence was often superseded by judicial combat and the Assise of Jerusalem admits in many cases this barbarous institution which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of Europe </s>

<s> The form of their remonstrances is conceived with the noble simplicity of freedom.] The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which affected the life or limb or honor of any person and in all civil transactions of or above the value of one mark of silver </s>
<s> It appears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of the accuser who except in a charge of treason avenged his personal injury or the death of those persons whom he had a right to represent but wherever from the nature of the charge testimony could be obtained it was necessary for him to produce witnesses of the fact </s>
<s> In civil cases the combat was not allowed as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant but he was obliged to produce witnesses who had or assumed to have knowledge of the fact </s>
<s> The combat was then the privilege of the defendant because he charged the witness with an attempt by perjury to take away his right </s>
<s> He came therefore to be in the same situation as the appellant in criminal cases </s>
<s> It was not then as a mode of proof that the combat was received nor as making negative evidence according to the supposition of Montesquieu 139 but in every case the right to offer battle was founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of an injury and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle and with the same spirit as a private duel </s>
<s> Champions were only allowed to women and to men maimed or past the age of sixty </s>
<s> The consequence of a defeat was death to the person accused or to the champion or witness as well as to the accuser himself but in civil cases the demandant was punished with infamy and the loss of his suit while his witness and champion suffered ignominious death </s>
<s> In many cases it was in the option of the judge to award or to refuse the combat but two are specified in which it was the inevitable result of the challenge if a faithful vassal gave the lie to his compeer who unjustly claimed any portion of their lord's demesnes or if an unsuccessful suitor presumed to impeach the judgment and veracity of the court </s>
<s> He might impeach them but the terms were severe and perilous in the same day he successively fought all the members of the tribunal even those who had been absent a single defeat was followed by death and infamy and where none could hope for victory it is highly probable that none would adventure the trial </s>
<s> In the Assise of Jerusalem the legal subtlety of the count of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude than to facilitate the judicial combat which he derives from a principle of honor rather than of superstition </s>

<s> Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their lords under the banner of the cross and it was the policy of the French princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of the rights and privileges of freemen </s>
<s> It is expressly declared in the Assise of Jerusalem that after instituting for his knights and barons the court of peers in which he presided himself Godfrey of Bouillon established a second tribunal in which his person was represented by his viscount </s>
<s> The jurisdiction of this inferior court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom and it was composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy citizens who were sworn to judge according to the laws of the actions and fortunes of their equals </s>
<s> 141 In the conquest and settlement of new cities the example of Jerusalem was imitated by the kings and their great vassals and above thirty similar corporations were founded before the loss of the Holy Land </s>
<s> Another class of subjects the Syrians 142 or Oriental Christians were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy and protected by the toleration of the state </s>
<s> Godfrey listened to their reasonable prayer that they might be judged by their own national laws </s>
<s> A third court was instituted for their use of limited and domestic jurisdiction the sworn members were Syrians in blood language and religion but the office of the president in Arabic of the rais was sometimes exercised by the viscount of the city </s>
<s> At an immeasurable distance below the nobles the burgesses and the strangers the Assise of Jerusalem condescends to mention the villains and slaves the peasants of the land and the captives of war who were almost equally considered as the objects of property </s>
<s> The relief or protection of these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the legislator but he diligently provides for the recovery though not indeed for the punishment of the fugitives </s>
<s> Like hounds or hawks who had strayed from the lawful owner they might be lost and claimed the slave and falcon were of the same value but three slaves or twelve oxen were accumulated to equal the price of the war horse and a sum of three hundred pieces of gold was fixed in the age of chivalry as the equivalent of the more noble animal </s>
