<s>   Look at the song title I Am a God and it seems like easy blasphemy Kanye West's update of John Lennon's more popular than Jesus shocker from 1966 </s>
<s> But just as the Beatle's proclamation was fuller and wiser in context I believe that what people call God is something in all of us Lennon would later explain I Am a God is not simply the latest selfimportant blast from one of pop culture's preeminent egoists </s>
<s> For starters the track sounds less triumphant than breathtakingly vexed crashing in with a gnarled dancehall vocal sample and paranoid sawtooth synths that aim to destroy </s>
<s> Here Kanye raps about loyalty respect threesomes and yes croissants with the urgency of someone being chased by a 30ton steamroller </s>
<s> The song is pierced by a series of primal screams pixelated outbursts that are only briefly able to halt the beat's heaving evil </s>
<s> In Kanye's hands being a god sounds stressful as hell something we can all relate to and the song's apparent inspiration is a passage from the book of Psalms I have said Ye are gods and all of you are children of the most High </s>
<s>  These are the immeasurably lofty stakes Kanye deals in on Yeezus his sixth solo album </s>
<s> His intensity here has a heightened desperation as he howls into the void but the Chicago native has always been beguiled by the view from above </s>
<s> Take Jesus Walks where he references another Psalm while gasping from on high I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless </s>
<s> Then on POWER he contemplates leaping out of the penthouse letting everything go </s>
<s> In a way Yeezus is the panicked sound of that ensuing freefall a rush of angst and despair with absolutely nothing left to lose </s>
<s>  The album is something of a razorsharpened take on 2008's distressed 808s & Heartbreak and marks a blunt break with the filigreed maximalism Kanye so thoroughly nailed on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </s>
<s> In hindsight the latter record with its ingratiating GOOD Fridays buildup endless guest list and uncharacteristically apologetic interview sessions was his attempt at recapturing a superstarsized American audience after a slew of entertainingyetquestionable PR incidents </s>
<s> Except it didn't exactly work While Twisted Fantasy was universally lauded and went platinum it still stands as Kanye's worstselling album to date failing to produce a top 10 single </s>
<s> But even if it wasn't a chart smash the intricacy and durability of Twisted Fantasy incubated the Cult of Kanye to an extreme level </s>
<s> I’d rather piss a bunch of people off and make myself happy than make everyone else happy and be pissed off inside he told VIBE around the release of 808s </s>
<s> Yeezus doublesdown on this exclusionary philosophy Soon as they like you make 'em unlike you 'Cause kissing people ass is so unlike you </s>
<s>  For Kanye there's purpose in repulsion </s>
<s> And on Yeezus he trades out smooth soul and anthemic choruses for jarring electro acid house and industrial grind while delivering some of his most lewd and heartcrushing tales yet </s>
<s> This is willful provocation that Ice Cube Madonna and Trent Reznor could all be proud of </s>
<s> Some of the record has him tackling the same issues he's been rapping about since The College Dropout albeit with a fireeyed stare </s>
<s> On his debut's Family Business he poignantly lamented a jailed cousin's absence at the Thanksgiving dinner table in a manner so sweet like a photo of your granny's picture </s>
<s> On Yeezus he's still addressing the plight of incarcerated black men but now he's incensed </s>
<s> With New Slaves he confronts us with vulgar stereotypes while exposing the prisonindustrial complex for the deeply systemic racist sham that it is </s>
<s>  Meanwhile XXX creeper I'm In It sounds like a dancehall orgasm mired in quicksand and makes previous comeons like Slow Jamz come off like Disney theme songs </s>
<s> The kids and the wife life but can't wake up from the nightlife says the new father on that track's knowingly buttonpushing final verse </s>
<s> I'm so scared of my demons I go to sleep with a nightlight </s>
<s> Kanye told The New York Times he's recently reached a new level of Zen but this is the opposite of beachchair music </s>
<s> Perhaps the album's most explicit lines are the blurry fantasies of a confessed porn addict who's described his daughter's mother as a superstar all from a home movie </s>
<s> Without much room for levity Kanye's complicated and distrustful view of women is unrelenting on Yeezus </s>
<s> And while there's no real excuse for flat oafishness like eatin' Asian pussy all I need was sweet and sour sauce many of the album's most powerful moments have him broken down insecure and bloody railing against an ineptitude with the opposite sex </s>
<s>  Album pinnacle Blood on the Leaves tells a nightmarish story of divorce and betrayal all while samples of Nina Simone's pitchedup Strange Fruit and TNGHT's demonic R U Ready horns play yin and yang to the protagonist's alternately sorrowful and furious headspace </s>
<s> Hold My Liquor and Guilt Trip meanwhile find Kanye trying to restate his manhood while his emotions crumble around him if he's not drunk and swervey trying vainly to reconcile with an ex he's hoping to brag himself out of being dumped </s>
<s> Caustic humor shows up now and then buoying certain lines or tracks like Send It Up and Bound 2 but it's often fleeting </s>
<s> As on Runaway there's something palpably sad about the men in these songs which twists them away from misogynistic assertions of power toward feelings that are ultimately more selfdestructive </s>
<s> As contemporaries like JayZ Beyoncé and Justin Timberlake increasingly devote their music to largely winning tales of contentment Kanye is unwilling or unable to settle for settling down </s>
<s>  This discomfort is essential to his enduring appeal </s>
<s> For instance instead of working with giant phone companies to guarantee commercial success a la his big brother Kanye's now making a point out of rejecting corporate sponsorship </s>
<s> Whether it's a meaningful stance or a blindly contrarian move is up for debate </s>
<s> But after recent tensions between hiphop and corporate America visceral and disturbing lines like put my fist in her like a civil rights sign put Kanye beyond the reach of mainstream brands hoping to siphon his credibility </s>
<s> As he told the Times he's not disinterested in the idea of big companies or big money he compared himself to Steve Jobs after all but he wants control </s>
<s>  The restlessness spreads to his aesthetic and collaborative choices </s>
<s> Rather than relying on known hitmakers to augment his music Kanye solicited ideas from exciting upandcomers including Hudson Mohawke Young Chop and Arca </s>
<s> And even veteran producers involved in the project like Rick Rubin and Daft Punk were seemingly chosen not for their name recognition but their history of rulebreaking </s>
<s> In the mid1980s Rubin veered away from the colorful partystarting tones of early rap music and created bare hard beats for LL Cool J RunD.M.C </s>
<s> and the Beastie Boys a perfect fit for Yeezus' lessismore snarl </s>
<s> And though Kanye's blaring digitized assault couldn't be further from Daft Punk's naturalistic groovebased Random Access Memories the artists share a basic philosophy </s>
<s> As Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter recently said of their new record We had the luxury to do things that so many people cannot do but it doesn't mean that with luxury comes comfort </s>
<s>  The idea extends to the how Yeezus treats the human voice </s>
<s> Running with the confounding hook from last year's Mercy dancehall patois is scattered throughout bringing with it that music's sense of menacing confrontation </s>
<s> And Bon Iver's Justin Vernon shows up on a few tracks using his voice to give the darkness an angelic tint </s>
<s> Expanding upon the cracked vocal experimentation on Twisted Fantasy's Blame Game Kanye's own voice is often shadowed by pitcheddown ghouls </s>
<s> And though he could've likely chosen any rapper on earth to guest on the riotous Send It Up probably the most likely if not only chance Yeezus has for a rapradio hit he chose Chicago's relatively unknown King L </s>
<s> His presence along with that of fellow Chitown driller Chief Keef makes the message clear America may want to ignore these young black men from the gangstrewn South Side but here they have a voice </s>
<s>  All of these unlikely choices demonstrate how cohesion and bold intent are at a premium on Yeezus perhaps more than any other Kanye album </s>
<s> Each fluorescent strike of noise incongruous tempo flip and warped vocal is bolted into its right place across the record's fast 40 minutes </s>
<s> The precise approach runs through Yeezus' guerrillastyle promotion too which found an army of dark vans lighting projections onto buildings around the world itself a bootsontheground reaction to today's InstaTweet brand of music dissemination </s>
<s> I went to one of these impromptu happenings last Saturday night in the middle of Manhattan </s>
<s> At 120 a.m. the words NOT FOR SALE lit up on the south side of the Louis Vuitton building </s>
<s> A few guys ran across the street with Christmasmorning glee snapping photos </s>
<s> Then Kanye's starklylit visage appeared to recite New Slaves's anticonsumerist lines as cabs streaked by the luxury stores below </s>
<s> His was the only black face to be seen across the jumbo ads lining an eerily desolate 5th Ave. The van soon closed its doors and drove away the culture bomb’s flash was over in an instant but the reverberations were just starting to spread </s>
