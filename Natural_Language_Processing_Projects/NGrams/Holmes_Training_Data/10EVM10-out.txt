<s> Contact Mike Lough Mikel@caere.com Vol. XXIII No.1 JULY 1910 THE LAYING OF THE MONSTER BY THEODOSIA GARRISON Dorothea reposed with her shoulders in the shade of the bulkhead and her bare feet burrowing in the sunwarmed sand </s>
<s> Beneath her shoulder blades was a bulky and disheveled volumea bound year of Godey's Lady Book of the vintage of the early seventies </s>
<s> Having survived the handling of three generations this seemed to take naturally to being drenched with rain and warped by sun or as at the present moment serving its owner either as a sandpillow or as a receptacle for divers scribbled verses on its flyleaves and margins </s>
<s> It was with a poem now that Dorothea was wrestling as she wriggled her toes in the sand and gazed blankly oceanward </s>
<s> Under the scorching August sun the Atlantic seemed to purr like a huge amiable lion cub </s>
<s> It was not the amiabilities of nature however in which Dorothea found inspiration </s>
<s> A harp of a single string she sang as that minstrel might who was implored to make love alone his theme </s>
<s> Given an imaginative young person of eleven who when not abandoning herself utterly to athletics has secret and continual access to the brand of literature peculiar to the Seaside Library and the result is obvious </s>
<s> Dorothea's mother read recipes her father was addicted to the daily papers </s>
<s> It was only in her grandmother that Dorothea found a literary taste she approved </s>
<s> On that cozy person's bookshelves one could always find what happened to Goldie or what the exquisite Irish heroine said to the earl before she eloped with the captain </s>
<s> In this knowledge Dorothea's parents had no ambition that their daughter should excel </s>
<s> In fact an uncompromising edict on the subject had been given forth more than once to a sullen and rebellious sinner </s>
<s> But how should the most suspicious parent when his daughter sits in his presence apparently engrossed in a book entitled The Girlhood of Famous Women guess that carefully concealed in its interior is a smaller volume bearing the title Muriel's Mistake or For Another's Sin </s>
<s> Having acquired knowledge the true student seeks to demonstrate </s>
<s> Dorothea had promptly and intentionally fallen in love with the son of her nextdoor neighbor </s>
<s> Amielfresh from his first year in college was a tall broadshouldered youth with kindly brown eyes and a flash of white teeth when he smiled </s>
<s> In contrast to the small boys and the sobergoing fathers of families in which the summer colony abounded he shone as Dorothea's favorite novelists would have expressed it like a Greek god </s>
<s> It was this unsuspecting person whom Dorothea had at first sight elected to be the Hero of her Dreams </s>
<s> She trailed him moreover with a persistency that would have done credit to a detective </s>
<s> Did he go to the postoffice he was sure to meet Dorothea returning Lady Ursula strolling through her estate comes upon her lover unawares </s>
<s> Dorothea emulating her heroine's example by vaulting a fence and cutting across lots could be found also strolling if slightly breathless as he approached </s>
<s> She timed her day as far as possible with his </s>
<s> Would he swim play tennis or go crabbingthere was Dorothea </s>
<s> Would he repose in the summerhouse hammock and listen to entire pages declaimed from Tennyson and Longfellow the while being violently swunghis slave was ready </s>
<s> She read no story in which she was not the heroine and Amiel the hero </s>
<s> At the same time she was perfectly and painfully conscious in the back of her brain that Amiel regarded her only as a sunbrowned cropheaded tomboy who had an extraordinary facility for remembering all the poetry she had ever read and who amused and interested him as his own small sister might </s>
<s> Outwardly she kept strictly to this rolea purely natural onewhile inwardly she soared dizzily from fantasy to fantasy even while her physical body was plunging in the waves or leaping on the tennis court </s>
<s> Could Amiel have had the slightest insight into the fancies seething in his small neighbor's mind he would have been astounded to the verge of doubting her reason </s>
<s> Little did he know as he stood now on the bulkhead and looked down at her that at the moment Dorothea was finishing mentally a poem in which with wild tears and clasping hands he had bidden her an eternal farewellby moonlight </s>
<s> She was moreover perturbed by the paucity of her native language </s>
<s> There appeared to be nothing to rhyme with love except shove above and dove </s>
<s> Of these one was impossible and two were trite </s>
<s> Scowling fiercely at the ocean she finally gave the bird to the hungry line and repeated the final couplet doubtfully `Farewell' he said </s>
<s> `Ah love my love My heart is breaking for thee Dove.' Look out </s>
<s> said a voice above her </s>
<s> I'm going to jump </s>
<s> Dorothea sat up delightedly with her bare brown legs tucked beneath her Turklike as she welcomed him </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> Beloved said Lady Ursula with her hand on her fluttering heart </s>
<s> Hello said Dorothea with a wide grin </s>
<s> He flung himself down beside her and surveyed her with amusement </s>
<s> Been digging holes with your head </s>
<s> he asked affably </s>
<s> Your hair and eyelashes look it </s>
<s> Been here all the afternoon </s>
<s> Yes she said </s>
<s> I saw you go riding after lunch </s>
<s> I've been here ever since </s>
<s> I love to be on the beach when there isn't a lot of people bothering around </s>
<s> Thenshe made a wide gesture with her brown hand all of it seems to belong to me not broken up in little bits for everybody </s>
<s> She shook her cropped head vigorously and the sand pelted down her shoulders </s>
<s> Well he said watching this operation you came near taking your little bit to the house with you to keep didn't you </s>
<s> How long have you worn your hair cropped like that Dorothea </s>
<s> Was it when you decided to be captain of a ball team </s>
<s> He drew a box of chocolates from his pocket and tossed it over to her </s>
<s> She caught it neatly on her outstretched palm as a boy would have done and nibbled squirrellike as she talked </s>
<s> She did not resent being teased by Amielshe liked it rather as representing a perfect understanding between them </s>
<s> Also once removed from the high hills of romance she was not devoid of humor </s>
<s> It was cut in Junebefore you came </s>
<s> They didn't want me to but I just begged them </s>
<s> It was such a nuisance bathing and then flopping about drying afterward and being sent upstairs all day long to make it smooth </s>
<s> You funny kid he said </s>
<s> You don't care how you look do you </s>
<s> You ought to have been a boy </s>
<s> What have you been doing down here all by yourself </s>
<s> Readingandlistening said Dorothea vaguely </s>
<s> She folded Godey's Lady Book tightly to her chest </s>
<s> Lady Ursula or no Lady Ursula she would have diedwith black bitter shame at the thought of any eye but her own falling upon the penciled lines therein </s>
<s> The horror of ridicule is the black shadow that hangs over youth </s>
<s> That strange inner world of her own Dorothea shared with nothing more substantial than her dreams </s>
<s> Listening </s>
<s> he inquired </s>
<s> To the ocean explained Dorothea </s>
<s> It was high tide when I came down and the waves boomboomed like that as though it were saying big words down in its chest you know </s>
<s> And what were the wild waves saying </s>
<s> Oh big words like she thought a moment her small sunburnt face serious and intent </s>
<s> Oh like Robert of Sicily Brother of Pope Urbane And Valmond Emperor of Allemaine </s>
<s> she intoned deeply </s>
<s> You see </s>
<s> Absolutely he said enjoyingly </s>
<s> And so you weren't lonesome </s>
<s> Dorothea who had spent her afternoon in a region peopled with interesting and exquisite figures shook her head </s>
<s> You don't get lonesome when you think she saidimagine was the word she meant she used the other as appealing to his understanding </s>
<s> Suddenly the vague introspective look left her face she turned to him with the expression of one imparting pleasing tidings </s>
<s> My friend is coming tomorrow to stay a week she said </s>
<s> You remember I told you that mother had asked her </s>
<s> Well she's coming down with father tomorrow </s>
<s> She has never been to the seashore before </s>
<s> You'll take us crabbing won't you Amiel </s>
<s> And if we have a bonfire you'll ask father to let us stay up won't you </s>
<s> Sure he said goodnaturedly </s>
<s> What's her name </s>
<s> Her name is Jennie Clark and she lives next door to us in the city and we're going to have funfunfun chanted Dorothea </s>
<s> Come on </s>
<s> She sprang lightly to her feet and dug her shoes and stockings out of the sand </s>
<s> We can have a game of tennis before dinner </s>
<s> Clutching her book with her shoes and stockings she raced with him to the steps that led to the bulkhead and from that eminencewith the air of one performing an accustomed actshe clambered on the fence that separated the green lawns from beach to avenue </s>
<s> This with a fine disregard for splinters she proceeded to walkher property tucked under her arm </s>
<s> Amiel strode beside her on the lawn </s>
<s> She was as surefooted as a goat but when he clutched her elbow as she performed a daring pirouette she offered no opposition but proceeded sedately beneath his hold </s>
<s> Why not </s>
<s> She had ceased to be Dorothea on her way to a tennis game Lean heavily on me dearest whispered Reginald the chapel is in sight </s>
<s> Bear up a little longer </s>
<s> With a weary sigh the Lady Ursula slid finally from the gatepost to the ground and proceeded to put on her stockings </s>
<s> Jennie Clark arrived duly and was received if not rapturously at least hospitably </s>
<s> To be frank Jennie Clark was not among those first suggested by Dorothea as a prospective visitor </s>
<s> Of her own private and particular friends some five had been rejected by a too censorious parent mainly it seemed because of a lack of personal charmDorothea preferring a good sport from the gutter as it were to a dull fairy from a dancing school </s>
<s> Jennie had been near perilously near the end of Dorothea's list </s>
<s> Her sole claims to Dorothea's friendship were that living next door she was available on rainy days when greater delights failed and that Dorothea by a dramatic relation of a ghost story could hypnotize her into a terrified and wholly fascinated wreck </s>
<s> Jennie was thirteen a very young thirteenpretty and mindless as a Persian kittenbut developing rapidly a coquettish instinct for the value of a red ribbon in her dark curls and the set of a bracelet on her plump arm </s>
<s> Beside her curves and curls and pretty frilled frocks Dorothea in her straight blue flannel playing suit or stiff afternoon pique' with her cropped blonde head suggested nothing so much as wire opposed to a sofa cushion </s>
<s> She was in white pique' this afternoon </s>
<s> To meet one's friend at the station was an event </s>
<s> Dorothea was honestly excited and happy and she was not at all pained that Jennie Clark's first greeting was a comment on her short hair and her sunburn </s>
<s> By what might have seemed to the unobserving a happy coincidence Amiel strolling from his house to the beach with his after dinner pipe was hailed by Dorothea from the summerhouse </s>
<s> She had run the unsuspecting Miss Clark very hard to arrive at the psychological moment </s>
<s> Joining them there he was duly presented to Jennie Clark and Dorothea accepting the courteous fashion in which he acknowledged the introduction as an indirect compliment to herself was elated </s>
<s> Jennie was certainly very pretty </s>
<s> She tossed back her long curls and talked to Amiel with an occasional droop of her long lashes and Dorothea beaming upon them both had no notion that hovering above her in the quiet twilight the green eyed Monster was even then scenting its victim and preparing to strike </s>
<s> Presently Dorothea's father and mother and Amiel's stout and amiable parents joined their offspring in the summerhouse </s>
<s> One of the affable if uninteresting neighbors came as well and promptly introducing a banjo as a reason for his being lured the assembled company into song </s>
<s> Dorothea snuggled into her corner blissfully conscious of Amiel's careless arm about her shoulder gave herself up to happiness </s>
<s> The night was soft as velvet sewn with the gold spangles of stars </s>
<s> The waves whispered secrets to each other as they waited for the moon to rise </s>
<s> Dorothea rapturously using the atmosphere as a background for Lady Ursula became suddenly aware that the singing of Juanita in six different keys had ceased and that Jennie having been discovered to be the possessor of a voice was singing alone </s>
<s> She had an exquisite little pipe and she sang the dominating sentimental song of the year with ease if not with temperament </s>
<s> Its close was greeted with instant and enthusiastic applause </s>
<s> Jennie became instantly the center of attraction </s>
<s> It was Amiel who urged her to sing again Amiel who seized upon the banjo and accompanied her triumphantly through a college song turning his back squarely upon Dorothea the while </s>
<s> Dorothea sat up straight a sudden bewildering anger at her heart as she watched them </s>
<s> In the midst of the song she announced casually that the moon was coming up </s>
<s> No one paid the slightest attention to her except the calling neighbor who said Hush </s>
<s> An instant later the instant that saw Amiel lay a commending and fraternal hand on Jennie's curls the Monster struck </s>
<s> Jealousy had no firmer grip of beak and talons on the Moor of Venice than on the cropheaded Dorothea </s>
<s> In absolute self defense she did an unprecedented and wholly unexpected thing </s>
<s> Without warning she burst into song even as Jennie was coyly preparing for an encore </s>
<s> O fair dove O fond dove </s>
<s> O dove with the white white breast shrilled Dorothea to her startled audience </s>
<s> This was the same song with which Lady Ursula invariably brought blinding bitter tears to the eyes of those assembled at picnics and hunt balls </s>
<s> It had an opposite effect upon Dorothea's auditors </s>
<s> With apparently one accord they burst into hilarious mirth comment and expostulation </s>
<s> My child </s>
<s> Where did you get that absurd song </s>
<s> Dorothea never try to sing again </s>
<s> I forbid it </s>
<s> This last from her father </s>
<s> It was Amiel who commented admiringly on the fact that Dorothea with practice might go through an entire song without once touching upon the tune and time and Jennie who giggled enjoyingly and said Oh Dorothea you're awfully funny </s>
<s> Dorothea sat out the rest of the evening in stony silence which nobody regarded </s>
<s> She refused to join in the various choruses no one noticed the omission in the least </s>
<s> When at last she walked to the house with Amiel between herself and Jennie and haughtily shrugged her shoulder away from his hand he continued listening to Jennie's prattle without giving the slightest attention to her aloofness </s>
<s> Long after Jennie was asleep Dorothea wideeyed communed with the Monster </s>
<s> This was not an imitation Lady Ursula jealousy at all </s>
<s> That was an interesting game at which one played when Amiel occasionally walked and talked with some stray damsel in the colony </s>
<s> She had no real jealousy of the young ladyhood that at times intruded </s>
<s> But this was different here she was out ranked in HER OWN CLASS </s>
<s> In that lay the sting </s>
<s> She reflected dismally that this was only Tuesday and that Jennie was to stay until the following Monday </s>
<s> She was perfectly and miserably fair in recounting Jennie's attractions as contrasted with her own </s>
<s> She Dorothea could at demand which was seldom reel off pages of poetry Jennie could singto appreciative audiences </s>
<s> Dorothea could swim and dive Jennie had curly hair </s>
<s> Plainly Jennie had all the best of it </s>
<s> It remained only for Dorothea not to forget the courtesy due a guest and above all oh above everything not to show the slightest trace of the jealousy that consumed her </s>
<s> Lady Ursula had several times been the life of the party when her heart was breaking </s>
<s> Her proud smile had never faltered in the presence of her rival </s>
<s> Well neither would Dorothea's </s>
<s> She assumed it instantly in the darkness by way of immediate practice and fell asleep with the result plastered upon her face </s>
<s> In the morning the Monster wearied perhaps by his session of the night before seemed to lie dormant </s>
<s> Dorothea woke jubilant as the morn and having roused her friend by the gentle method of half stifling her with a pillow rushed her through her dressing and led her forth </s>
<s> The ocean welcomed them with rapture it caught the sun for them and threw it back in millions and millions of living rainbowed diamonds </s>
<s> The world was all gold and blue and tremulous with clean salt winds </s>
<s> It seemed ridiculous that one could be unhappy on such a day </s>
<s> Dorothea danced paganlike at the wave edge while Jennie watched demurely from the bulkhead </s>
<s> However it appeared that even on a day like this one could carry black envy at one's heart </s>
<s> It was during the bathing hour that the Monster again asserted himselfthis time for no indefinite stay </s>
<s> As a rule the bathing hour was one in which Dorothea reveled </s>
<s> Arrayed in her faded bathing suit guiltless of skirt or sleeves her prowess as an amphibious creature had been highly commended by that one for whose praise she would gladly have precipitated herself from the highest pier </s>
<s> In vain today did she perform feats of daring and agility that would have done credit to a flying fish </s>
<s> No one had eyes for her except an agitated mother and grandmother who finally ordered her summarily out of the water and into the bath house </s>
<s> Amiel had occupied himself in coaxing Jennie into the water and giving her primary instructions in swimming </s>
<s> Jennie in the daintiest red and white suit that could be imagined skirted and stockinged with her curls escaping from a coquettish red handkerchief timorously advancing and drawing back from the wave rush with little appealing cries was as fascinating as a playful kitten </s>
<s> Dorothea regarded her with the disgust of the seasoned veteran for the raw recruit </s>
<s> This however her erstwhile friend might have been pardoned for not suspecting seeing that whenever she caught Dorothea's eye she was immediately the recipient of a wide and beaming smile that even one less vain might have accepted as a tribute to her attractions </s>
<s> It never wavered even while Jennie shook down her long curls ostensibly to let the sun dry a single lock that in some unaccountable way had felt the touch of a wave </s>
<s> Beamingly Dorothea heard Amiel humorously contrast this brown glory with her own short crop </s>
<s> Beamingly she fell into the plans for the crabbing party that afternoon </s>
<s> However it was this lightsome expedition that laid the last straw upon the Monster's back </s>
<s> The gentle art of crabbing involves the carrying of a longhandled net and a huge basket and a stop at the butcher's to purchase unsavory lumps of meat for bait </s>
<s> Hitherto Dorothea had always proudly and vehemently insisted upon carrying the basket the long hot mile to the bay </s>
<s> Today as Amiel dropped the bait in and handed it to her as a matter of course she accepted it with the look of the proud spirit that will not cry out beneath indignities </s>
<s> She hung the basket over her blue flanneled arm and trudged valiantly before them </s>
<s> The afternoon was one of long and unprecedented martyrdom </s>
<s> Dorothea reviewed it as she changed into her white pique' for dinner the while beamingly advising Jennie as to the selection of hair ribbons </s>
<s> SHE had vaulted fences Jennie had been assisted </s>
<s> SHE had baited lines Jennie's had been baited </s>
<s> The fact that a week before the offer of help in that delicate operation would have been regarded as an insult to her intelligence failed to occur to her today </s>
<s> She burned with humiliation as she remembered that after a half hour of seeing Jennie's line carefully prepared she had handed her own to Amiel with the air of one doing only what was expected of her </s>
<s> Amiel in return had stared at her and in the tone he might have used to a younger brother had said briefly Well go on and bait it </s>
<s> What's the matter </s>
<s> She had baited it </s>
<s> Also she had carried home the net while Amiel had borne the spoils and protested courteously when Jennie offered an assisting hand </s>
<s> It was dreary consolation to realize that never for a moment had the proud smile wavered </s>
<s> She was beginning to feel as though an elastic band had been stretched for hours under her nose and behind her ears and the sole comment her lofty amiability had drawn forth had been a reference to the famed animal of Cheshire </s>
<s> From her window she presently saw Jennie all rosy muslin and tossing curls strolling beachward with Amiel </s>
<s> The sight nerved her to demonstrate an idea that had occurred to her inspiringly during the day </s>
<s> Once by simply placing a dewy rose in her golden torrent of hair Lady Ursula had brought the ball room to her feet </s>
<s> In emulation Dorothea extracted a hair ribbon from Jennie's stock and failing other means tied it bandagewise about her head </s>
<s> The result was not coquettish </s>
<s> It suggested only accident or disease </s>
<s> She removed it wearily and sat down on the edge of the bed to think </s>
<s> Plainly she could not compete with Jennie on the grounds of beauty or accomplishments </s>
<s> Apparently the fact of being able to swim vault and leap from vast heights constituted none of these things </s>
<s> And yet before Jennie arrivedand doubtless after Jennie departedafter these five interminable days that stretched before herbut why five </s>
<s> The dinner bell rang insistently </s>
<s> Some one was calling her from the stairs </s>
<s> Dorothea sat still with her arms folded on the bedpost and a new thought playing like summer lightning in her brain </s>
<s> The thought gradually resolved itself into a problem </s>
<s> It was well enough to decide that Jennie must gothe problem was how to make her go </s>
<s> A telegram or a letter summoning her home </s>
<s> A good idea if there were any one in the city to send it </s>
<s> That was obviously impossible </s>
<s> Dorothea walked downstairs with her brows knitted in thought above the unchanging smile and in her eyes the look of the rapt soul momentarily expecting inspiration </s>
<s> The inspiration arrived during that hour when the denizens of the little colony sat ringwise about the beach fire </s>
<s> The neighbor with the banjo had done his worst and desisted Jennie had piped through her repertoire and was now graciously accepting the support of Amiel's arm </s>
<s> Dorothea and the Monster somewhat withdrawn from the circle watched a crooked moon lift itself above the horizon and lay a trail of opal glory on the waves </s>
<s> Still awaiting inspiration she regarded it with as little interest as Lucretia Borgia might have given the sunset that preceded one of her little poisoning dinners </s>
<s> Presently as befitted the atmosphere and hour the talk of the little circle fell upon things ghostly and mysteriousstrange happenings and prophetic dreams </s>
<s> Dorothea who had a love of horrors lent a suddenly attentive ear but Jennie though plainly fascinated uttered a protesting plaint </s>
<s> Oh please stop </s>
<s> You don't know how you frighten me </s>
<s> Dorothea has had some awfully queer things happen to her and it scares me almost to death when she tells about them </s>
<s> Mirth followed the announcement of Dorothea's occult powers which needless to say had come as a surprise to her immediate family </s>
<s> Dorothea paid no attention whatever </s>
<s> Instead she rose to her feet and flinging her arms wide yawned elaborately </s>
<s> It was a delicate suggestion which caused the men to look at their watches and the party forthwith dispersed </s>
<s> Dorothea for all the sand in her shoes seemed to walk to the house on air </s>
<s> The inspiration had arrived fully accoutered as it were on the breath of Jennie's complaint </s>
<s> The work in hand called for the dexterity of the true artist </s>
<s> With managerial instinct Dorothea repelling any attempt at conversation waited only until Jennie was comfortably ensconced in bed to turn the lamp down so that it glimmered in sickly fashion before beginning proceedings </s>
<s> Then seating herself beside the bedan eerie figure in her straight white gownshe shook her head dismally and indulged in a heartfelt sigh </s>
<s> Jennie her nerves already on edge with the ghost stories of the hour before turned startled eyes upon her </s>

<s> Ifeelstrange said Dorothea </s>
<s> She turned upon her victim a face full of uncanny suggestion </s>
<s> Divested of its perpetual smile it seemed to Jennie as unfamiliar as a room from which an accustomed piece of furniture had been moved </s>
<s> I feelstrange </s>
<s> Something terrible is happening somewhere.I can tellI always canI am going to have a visionI can feel itIt always comes like this </s>
<s> With a quick hand she extinguished the lamp </s>
<s> It will come in a dream she muttered </s>
<s> Let me sleep oh let me sleep </s>
<s> She made a sweeping pass with her out stretched hands and after a dramatic pause fell heavily on her pillow where she instantly proceeded to fall into a deep and trancelike slumbera slumber that prevailed through the terrified questionings whimperings and agitated shakings by her friend </s>
<s> It is an awesome thing to seek repose beside one wrapped in trance it is worse to traverse unlighted halls and ghostly stairs in an effort to awake the gifted medium's family </s>
<s> Wrapped in terror as in an icy sheet after divers Herculean efforts to rouse the log beside her the responsive victim fell into a troubled slumber with her head well under the bedclothes </s>
<s> The gray dawn was in the room when she was awakened by what seemed to be muffled sobs fromthe figure beside her </s>
<s> In an instant wide awake and palpitating she fell upon Dorothea </s>
<s> What is it </s>
<s> Oh what is it </s>
<s> she cried </s>
<s> I have had it said Dorothea in a sepulchral whisper </s>
<s> The vision </s>
<s> Oh she turned dramatically from the instant question I can't bear to tell you!It was about you </s>
<s> Dorothea you've GOT to tell me </s>
<s> I think you're HORRID </s>
<s> I'm going right downstairs to tell your mother </s>
<s> Of course I'm going to tell you said the sybil crossly </s>
<s> She resumed her chest tones hurriedly </s>
<s> I must tell you </s>
<s> It was sent to me to tell you </s>
<s> I wanted to prepare you </s>
<s> Prepare </s>
<s> Oh Dorothea what WAS it </s>
<s> Dorothea stood upright on the bed and her eyes assumed the expression of those that see inwardJennie stared at her hypnotized breathless </s>
<s> I saw a room chanted the inspired one a room in a large city </s>
<s> I can see it now </s>
<s> It is a bedroom </s>
<s> There are blue rugs on the floor and the furniture is oak </s>
<s> It has two windows </s>
<s> There is a canary bird in one and the other has a seat with blue cushions </s>
<s> Why that is my mother's room Dorothea </s>
<s> You know it is </s>
<s> In the bed a woman is lying </s>
<s> She is sick </s>
<s> She is turning from one side to the othershe says `Oh where is my daughter </s>
<s> I want my daughter </s>
<s> Why doesn't she come back to me?' Oh Dorothea </s>
<s> Jennie tearful and excited began to draw on her clothes </s>
<s> That was my mother </s>
<s> It must have been </s>
<s> Oh Dorothea </s>
<s> The sybil drove in the fine point again </s>
<s> `Why doesn't she come back to me?' she reiterated </s>
<s> The program that had proceeded so smoothly now received an unexpected hitch </s>
<s> Jennie paused suddenly in her garmenting relief growing in her face </s>
<s> After all she observed I don't believe mother had anything more than one of her sickheadaches </s>
<s> She has them all the time </s>
<s> I wouldn't go home just for that </s>
<s> I do believe that is it Dorothea </s>
<s> It was time for rapid thought </s>
<s> Another moment and the fine dramatic work of the morning would have gone for naught </s>
<s> For a moment Dorothea staggered but for a moment only </s>
<s> I didn't tell you everything she said mysteriously </s>
<s> Your mother is not alone in the bed </s>
<s> She is holding something in her arms </s>
<s> She is saying she paused to give her climax its full effect `Oh why doesn't Jennie come home to see her little sister?' Her little?Dorothea </s>
<s> It behooves the villain to be without conscience </s>
<s> No slightest shame visited the brazen one's heart at the sight of Jennie's instant joy and excitement </s>
<s> Modestly she accepted the tribute to her uncanny power obligingly she assisted her friend to pack martyrlike she acquiesced in Jennie's decision that the first train after breakfast would be none too early to bear her to that longcoveted delighta baby sister </s>
<s> Moreover she cannily advised her friend as to the mode of proceeding </s>
<s> If you tell them downstairs why you are going they may not let you </s>
<s> They don't know about visions </s>
<s> Just tell them that you're going home and NOTHING ELSE </s>
<s> This advice followed to the letter produced no little agitation at the breakfast table </s>
<s> Jennie simply announced her intention of immediate departure all questions as to her health happiness and possible reasons were met only with a parrotlike repetition of the fact </s>
<s> Upon closer pressing she gave way to hysterical tears Dorothea the while assisting the scene with round innocent eyes and the bewildered air of one suddenly made aware of an impending event </s>
<s> The solution was presently found by a sympathetic and consoling circlethe child was homesick she wanted her mother </s>
<s> Assuredly that explained everything </s>
<s> The lure of sails and picnics having failed Dorothea's mother came to a decision with sympathetic tears in her eyes and a glance toward her own innocent </s>
<s> She shall take the first train home if she wants to </s>
<s> The child sha'n't be miserable </s>
<s> No don't urge her Bob </s>
<s> I was homesick myself once and I understand perfectly </s>
<s> Dorothea reposed in the shade of the bulkhead sand on her person and a great peace in her heart upon which the Monster departing had left no scar </s>
<s> Under her head was the Godey's Lady's Book in which over the picture of a brocaded pelisse she had recently finished a poem in which lover rhymed with forever </s>
<s> Amiel crosslegged on the sand beside her was whistling gently as he industriously whittled at a bit of driftwood little suspecting that at the moment he was taking tea in a bower with Lady Ursula </s>
<s> Presently he drew a letter from his pocket and flipped it over to Dorothea </s>
<s> Your mother asked me to give you this he said </s>
<s> She thought it might be from that pretty little friend of yours </s>
<s> Dorothea opened the letter with some trepidation </s>
<s> Presently a bland smile over spread her countenance </s>
<s> The day of reckoning that she expected to dawn upon her next meeting with her victim melted cloudlike as she read Dear Dorothea I arrived home safely </s>
<s> It's just as well I did because my aunt was waiting to take me to Lake George but you made a mistake in the vision </s>
<s> It wasn't my mother </s>
<s> It was Mrs. Gray across the street and hers is a boy but I think that was very near </s>
<s> I think the vision was perfectly wonderful but I am glad I don't have them </s>
<s> My mother says I can come again later if your mother wants me </s>
<s> I didn't tell her why I came home because she doesn't believe in them either </s>
<s> She presented her love to several people and added in a postscript Let me know at Lake George if you have another </s>

<s> Vol. XXIII No.1 JULY 1910 pages 4455 THE GOLD BRICK AND THE GOLD MINE Fake Mining Schemes that Steal the People's Savings By EMERSON HOUGH Author of The Mississippi Bubble 5440 or Fight etc </s>
<s> EDITOR'S NOTE.It is time vigorous efforts were made to stop the cruel frauds perpetrated on the name of one of the world's greatest industries </s>
<s> Mining is a legitimate and honorable enterprise </s>
<s> It contributes immensely to the national wealth </s>
<s> It has been the source of some of our great fortunes </s>
<s> Because there is something magical in the suggestion of gold or coal or copper taken out of the ground sharpers have made mining an instrument of successful deception </s>
<s> They have tricked people into investing their savings in worthless or even nonexistent mines </s>
<s> Perhaps you who read this have bitten at an advertisement in a reputable publication which pretended to place the wealth of some western El Dorado at your feet for a few hundred dollars </s>
<s> Doubtless your money has disappeared </s>
<s> It is for the purpose of giving you the protection of a knowledge both of legitimate mining and of the ways of thieves that this article is published </s>
<s> AMERICA is the land of the free and the country of opportunity for all </s>
<s> Incidentally it is free huntingground for sharpers and a land of opportunity for the unscrupulous </s>
<s> No such chances for fraudulent business exist anywhere else in the world </s>
<s> Americans are the richest people on earth and the most easily parted from their money </s>
<s> Those whose sole ambition is to get rich quick very frequently help some other man to get rich quick </s>
<s> Society owes no debt to either of these </s>
<s> It is obliged to support them both </s>
<s> This is wrong both as a moral and as an industrial proposition </s>
<s> Once a dollar was spent to mine a dollar </s>
<s> Today two are spent One dollar goes into blasting powder the other into advertising and office furniture </s>
<s> No doubt you have heard the ageold legend of the Mother Vein of Gold which appears and vanishes now and again in this corner of the world </s>
<s> Superstition regarding this great original vein of gold is found wherever men seek the precious metal </s>
<s> The feverish Spaniards called this phantom lode the Madre d'Oro or Mother of Gold </s>
<s> Now it is located in Mexico now in India or Peru California or Australia </s>
<s> Tradition says that Montezuma got his gold from this great vein which lay in a secret valley whose whereabouts was jealously guarded by three priests of the war tribe sole possessors of the knowledge </s>
<s> Any intruder who by chance or design looked down into this valley was smitten absolutely blind </s>
<s> Tradition among the successors of the Aztecs says that when Montezuma passed the Madre d'Oro sank back again into the earth and has been seen no more </s>
<s> Men still follow the phantom vein </s>
<s> Those who see it even in their dreams still are smitten blind </s>
<s> Gold </s>
<s> There is no other word that means quite so much </s>
<s> We want gold indeed we must have it </s>
<s> Malleable divisible indestructible rare it is the indispensable medium of exchange </s>
<s> It is our chosen unit of power and success the measure of civilization and human attainment </s>
<s> Hence it has always been the object of human desire </s>
<s> The Golden Fleece very probably was the sheepskin bottom of an oldtime sluicebox in a day when they used wool instead of blankets below the rocker troughs </s>
<s> In the vast ruined civilization of Southeast Africa unknown men once mined probably 400000000 worth of gold </s>
<s> There are mines profitably operated in Greece today which the Phoenicians opened 1200 B </s>
<s> C </s>
<s> Sixteen hundred years later the Romans owned all the mines in Europe </s>
<s> Hannibal once paid his warriors in gold coin of Carthage </s>
<s> Egypt was settled by the Semitic races 2500 B </s>
<s> C </s>
<s> because of the gold that was found there </s>
<s> A thousand years later Job knew about gold and five hundred years later still King Solomon showed what an abundance of wives and what a reputation for wisdom a man can get when he has unlimited gold mines back of him </s>
<s> Columbus found America when he was searching for the wealth of Ormus and of Ind </s>
<s> Cortez and Pizarro toiled and slew in the hope of finding the Madre d'Oro </s>
<s> The great discoveries of the world have been made by men in search of gold </s>
<s> The great voyages of exploration were in part piratical voyages made in search of gold already found and mined by others </s>
<s> HONEST MINING IN HANNIBAL'S TIME But there is to be said about gold mining ways of the old time that Tyre sought gold with actual ships with actual men and mining implements </s>
<s> The peninsula of Sinai did not sell stock but mined actual gold </s>
<s> Gold in those days meant actual risk and courage </s>
<s> Perhaps even then fraudulent promoters weren't unknown but he who ventured in the days of Vespasian or Hannibal or Hiram too prominently to gild the gold brick certainly lost his head </s>
<s> The mining of gold was then a sober and serious and honest matter </s>
<s> In America we place the gold brick ahead of the gold mine </s>
<s> We mix alloy of duplicity and greed with the virgin metal of our standard of value </s>
<s> By improved mining methods we nearly double our output of gold and so cheapen it by wellnigh a half </s>
<s> This shrunken gold dollar is small enough but that is not all </s>
<s> We adulterate and divide it by say another half when we falsely double its cost </s>
<s> This we certainly do when we issue counterfeit promises as against good coin for in civilization and commerce always the genuine coinage has to pay the cost of the counterfeit </s>
<s> Your tailor charges you a stiff price for your suit of clothes </s>
<s> That covers the clothes of the dead beats who did not pay </s>
<s> To allow the sale of a fraudulent mining stock is to depreciate the basis of this country's values </s>
<s> Such a wrong ought not to be allowed in a country claiming an enlightened government </s>
<s> It is the thief who is protected in America not his dupe </s>
<s> The old law of caveat emptor protects the SELLER of fake mining stocks not the BUYER of them </s>
<s> There is little or no actually enforced law to protect the latter </s>
<s> That is to say there is little or no actually enforced law to protect those who most need protection those of small incomes orphans who have no guardians wage earners who have little education widows whose life insurance is not quite enough to support them women engaged in the desperate battle of life and needing more money quick money better to protect themselves </s>
<s> The fence between these and the natural perils of the world is slight enough </s>
<s> In America we break it down entirely </s>
<s> We offer these helpless ones freely as victims to the greater cunning and strength of men wholly without sense of business honor or personal decency </s>
<s> When we do this we also attack the whole system of savings banks which is or should be the very bulwark of a nation's financial safety </s>
<s> Says the wolf to the widow to the busy professional man to the clerk the stenographer the wage earner Take your money out of the savings bank </s>
<s> What is three per cent </s>
<s> a year when I can make you three hundred per cent </s>
<s> a year </s>
<s> Give your money to me </s>
<s> We permit that </s>
<s> Our national government does not undertake to put a stop to it our states do not undertake to do so and this fact is more possible through actual lack of proper statutes than through any misinterpretation or lack of enforcement of the law </s>
<s> The field is one devised by nature for the trickster </s>
<s> His success does not depend altogether on human gullibility part of his argument rests on the conditions which surround the industry of mining one which never can be free of extreme risk </s>
<s> All men know that gold is found far away where living is high and means of transportation are scarce that it costs large sums to find and dig it and that such sums are more easily raised among the many than among the few </s>
<s> None of these attending features has weight to stop the capitalization of bonafide enterprises </s>
<s> These latter are used as bait by men who have nothing bonafide to offer and who make their fattest profits out of their shallowest shafts </s>
<s> THE SUCKER LIST IN WALL STREET Methods vary among such fraudulent operators but new victims continually are found </s>
<s> The sucker list of one firm in Wall Street numbers 110000 names selected as those of persons who will bite more than once at a mining scheme and whose records show that they have so bitten </s>
<s> This operator proudly declares that the only way a sucker can get his name off that list is to die </s>
<s> In the reorganization of the firm of Douglas Lacey & Co </s>
<s> of New York City it was discovered that 20000 persons had money invested in stocks of the company </s>
<s> The best bait in this particular operation was a trust fund established for the benefit of stockholders </s>
<s> The proceeds of the betterpaying mines were to be applied to pay dividends for those which were less successful </s>
<s> In this way the various directors of the many DouglasLacey Companies explained it was impossible for the investors to lose </s>
<s> But they did lose </s>
<s> The reorganization intended to save some of the better properties wiped out more than seventy per cent </s>
<s> of the small stockholderswidows schoolteachers stenographers washwomen scrubwomenall who once had a dollar in the stocking </s>
<s> Burr Brothers Inc. of New York used the effective bait of the instalment plan of payment </s>
<s> Their literature and advertising offered sudden wealth at twenty cents a share payments to be in instalments the best twenty offers to be accepted </s>
<s> It was pointed out that if one made one's weekly payment large enough to be included among the fortunate twenty one could have a nice clean certificate sent to one immediately and pay for it at one's leisure </s>
<s> If you think the operators could not afford to do that you are ignorant </s>
<s> There was an old negro woman in the South who often importuned her white friends for funds to build a certain somewhat mythical church </s>
<s> They asked her what she received for the time spent in collecting </s>
<s> I has what I gits was her frank response </s>
<s> She enunciated a great modern mining principle which has made fortunes in Denver Butte New York Boston and many other places where handsome lithographic work is done and where advertising space can be bought in journals considered reputable </s>
<s> NEW ENGLAND DONE BY AN INSANE MAN Sometimes there are victims in enterprises of this sort where there probably was no deliberate intent to deceive or to defraud </s>
<s> Not long ago in Boston one Henry D </s>
<s> Reynolds formerly president of the Reynolds Alaska Development Company was brought before the United States Circuit Court on the charge of using the United States mails with intent to defraud </s>
<s> Three alienists are said to have declared him insane </s>
<s> In 1907 exGovernor John G </s>
<s> Brady of Alaska endorsed Reynolds and his schemes and is reported to have collected in New England about 450000 for these Reynolds projects </s>
<s> Brady gave lectures and stereopticon exhibitions in New England churches </s>
<s> Reynolds took out an excursion of Boston and New England investors to Prince William Sound at one time and showed them the seacoast of Alaska practically all of which he claimed to own </s>
<s> At Boulder Bay he took his party into a long tunnel the face of which they were told was composed of solid copper ore </s>
<s> When they emerged into the garish light of day each was given a bright copper nugget said to have come from the mine </s>
<s> ALASKA REYNOLDSIZED Really according to local report these nuggets of native copper had been taken from sluice boxes on Chittitu Creek 235 miles inland </s>
<s> Reynolds so ran the story had treated them with an acid bath to brighten them knowing that bright bait is better </s>
<s> At any rate the good sober New Englanders went back home and sent him 300000 more which set him entirely dippy in local phrase </s>
<s> Reynolds's scheme was to run all the barber shops laundries bars and pretty much everything else on the Alaskan coast </s>
<s> A certain Sam Blum had a store and bank Reynolds wanted it and Blum it is alleged annexed 50000 of the New England money as a forfeited first payment on his property </s>
<s> A steamship company it was said got 75000 of money on a forfeit </s>
<s> So the good New England savings merrily disappeared in one of the most spectacular farces ever known in Alaska which latter is too good and valid and valuable a national possession to permit to be Reynoldsized as it has been </s>
<s> Reynolds in the belief of one who knew him well was a combination of the ignorant enthusiast the wild promoter and the crazy man and as for Brady another Alaskan called him nothing worse than an innocent old ninny </s>
<s> Yet even with so sorry a mental equipment these two took something like half a million out of conservative New England </s>
<s> The ease with which money can be raised for such enterprises by the deliberately fraudulent or the unintentionally insane continues one of the wonders of our civilization </s>
<s> Another kind of bait offered is that of the prominent name </s>
<s> This has proved more useful in England than in this country </s>
<s> Whittaker Wright was able to secure members of the nobility for his boards of directors and the English public swallowed his schemes one after another bait hook bob and sinker </s>
<s> In this country we have no lords whom we dearly love so the names of prominent literary or scientific men sometimes are employed by wise promoters </s>
<s> A prominent mining expert is excellent bait </s>
<s> Some good men have been used in this way and the bait of their reputation in other lines of activity has served to make ignorant and innocent people of small means swallow the hook hid in the lying statements which they have perhaps innocently certainly ignorantly fathered </s>
<s> We are all familiar with the literature of this class sent to us under the guise of personal and intimate confidence </s>
<s> Always that part of the communication is followed by the blackfaced type where the stinger lies concealed </s>
<s> The words AT ONCE usually come in capitals as do LAST CHANCE and PRICE POSITIVELY WILL ADVANCE AFTER TEN DAYS </s>
<s> Millions and millions of dollars have been extracted from the public by these means </s>
<s> There is no law against it </s>
<s> ADJOINING MINESGOOD BAIT Then there is the same old argument about wonderful properties adjoining such and such a dividendpaying property </s>
<s> Very often the properties are miles apart </s>
<s> They might be within twentyfive feet of each other and one still might be worthless and the other rich </s>
<s> The profits of old and famous properties very frequently are given in advertising literature of this class to show what money there is in mining </s>
<s> The property sold may be a tenfoot hole in a sandbank two thousand miles from any of these yet this absurd argument is sufficient to extract coin from the pocket of the American buyer </s>
<s> You can use Michigan to tout him on to Arizona Utah to land him in California Mexico to interest him in Alaska </s>
<s> Is it not true </s>
<s> There is no law against it </s>
<s> Again the appeal to your mining pocket may come not through the advertising page but in the proper person of the promoter or owner himself </s>
<s> For instance not long ago a gentleman from California came into my office </s>
<s> He owned a mine on the old and welltraced Mother Vein of Tuolumne County California </s>
<s> It had been well opened and showed in development according to a reputable engineer's report three million dollars' worth of ore in sight with many tons of the best ore already in the dump stuff which would run very high in value </s>
<s> At the proper time the gentleman carefully produced from his pocket a little ingot of pure gold product of one testmill run </s>
<s> He gave the best of references as to his responsibility </s>
<s> He offered to guarantee ten per cent </s>
<s> dividends on all money invested and declared that he had a banking proposition and not a mine </s>
<s> WHEELBARROW VS. 72000 My Christian friend said I to him you seem to have a good thing </s>
<s> How far is it from your mine dump to the nearest bank </s>
<s> About five miles he answered </s>
<s> In that case said I it seems to me you don't need to sell a hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock to build a stampmill </s>
<s> You need only enough to buy yourself a good strong wheelbarrow </s>
<s> In two or three months you can thus build your own stampmill and pay for it with ore and still have your mine all in your own hands </s>
<s> He could not see it that way and pursuing his own method he took 72000 in two weeks out of the city of Chicago from some of the best business men of that city </s>
<s> Now perhaps he had a real mine </s>
<s> I have no right to doubt that he had but the point of interest to the small investor is this NEITHER HAVE I ANY RIGHT TO BELIEVE THAT HE HAD </s>
<s> The thing for me to do had I wished to invest in this way would have been to send an expert to see the property personally </s>
<s> ENTER THE FINANCIAL AGENT In this game of plucking the dollars of the poor and the ignorant there has been a gradual improvement in methods </s>
<s> The constant aim has been first to increase the amount of the harvest second to reduce to a minimum the risk the reapers run of detection and punishment by the authorities </s>
<s> Experience in most lines of commercial activity has shown that the middlemen often gather in the largest profits and have the smallest losses </s>
<s> Many of those working the mining gameand by this is meant selling stocks on wind and waterhave made use of this fact </s>
<s> Today in the majority of cases we have in place of the prospector or the company selling stock direct to the suckers the financial or fiscal agent </s>
<s> He operates either under the name of a banking firm or as a security company which is generally a registered tradename intended as a cloak to cover the names of individuals not desirous of publicity </s>
<s> The financial agent of this description is in reality the organizer and promoter of the mining company whose stock he sells </s>
<s> But should trouble come along he is the first to assert that he has been deceived as well as his customers </s>
<s> He sells the shares of the mine on a commission basis so large that practically nothing is left for development </s>
<s> He takes out of the money secured large salaries and the entire expense of advertising and carrying on the exploitation </s>
<s> He prepares all the literature </s>
<s> One of the advantages he claims for his proposition is the wide distribution of the stock as a safeguard against assault by wicked Wall Street interests </s>
<s> CULLED TWO MILLIONS IN FOUR YEARS In this wide distribution however lies one of his own greatest safeguards against either criminal or civil prosecution </s>
<s> Scattered over the country are his investorsthe mill hand the poor seamstress the humble artisan whose total investments comprising perhaps all their savings seldom exceed one hundred dollars each and with their savings gone there isn't money left to pay carfare to the office of the financial agent let alone to undertake a civil suit or enlist the aid of the authorities </s>
<s> The poor seamstress has no way of knowing any of her fellow unfortunates </s>
<s> Hence the utter impossibility of cooperation in seeking to get back their savings </s>
<s> As an example of the fiscal agent there may be cited the concern of Douglas Lacey & Company already mentioned a concern which in four years through its operations in this country and in Canada culled from the people of this country according to its own statement over 2000000 in exchange for stock certificates in more than forty varieties of mining companies </s>
<s> Here is a letter written to a woman by this concern four years after she had invested all her savings in the stock of one of these companies through this concern showing the advantage of the fiscal agency plan DOUGLAS LACEY & CO </s>
<s> Financial Agents 66 Broadway </s>
<s> New York Cable Address DouglaceyAngloAmerican and Bedford McNeil Codes Telephone 790 & 791 Rector DEAR MADAM June 2 1908 </s>
<s> Replying to your favor of June 1st would say that we do not find in our files any recent letter from you and your letter addressed care of 44 Wall Street has probably gone to the Dead Letter Office from which you will in time receive it </s>
<s> Now in reply to your question we think if you are at all familiar with business procedure you will see that it would be impossible for the fiscal agents of any of the companies to return money which had been paid for shares and which had been turned over by the fiscal agents to the treasury of the various companies and expended in development work on the different properties </s>
<s> It is true that we have sold stock for our customers at various times and we are glad to do so when it is possible </s>
<s> At the present time however as this company is in process of reorganization there would be no market for its stock and for this reason we are unable to help you in the way you request </s>
<s> Very truly yours Douglas Lacey & Co </s>
<s> In pursuing this method few promoters have had the success of Dr. John Grant Lyman </s>
<s> He is credited with having gathered in a half million dollars in his International Zinc operations </s>
<s> This company was supposed to have valuable zinc properties in the Joplin district of Missouri </s>
<s> To unload its stock on the people of this country Lyman organized the firm of Joshua Brown & Company Bankers incorporated under the laws of West Virginia </s>
<s> Through them the stock was sold until the collapse of the scheme in 1901 when the investors found that what property it did own was heavily mortgaged </s>
<s> While the firm was taking in the money Lyman maintained a racing stable had a reputation as a daring automobilist and even invaded the sacred precincts of the New York Stock Exchange </s>
<s> LYMAN'S SCHEME TO GET STOCKING SAVINGS Three years ago the papers throughout this country were filled with the advertisements of the Union Securities Company selling the stock of the Boston Greenwater Copper Company </s>
<s> It was stated that the mine had cost 200000 and that so much ore was in sight that an offer of 400000 had been refused </s>
<s> The Union Securities Company with offices in New York and in Goldfield Nevada started the stock at fortyfive cents and lifted it to a dollar </s>
<s> It was merely another name for John Grant Lyman </s>
<s> Not only did the Union Securities company sell the stock to the public but it also offered it to brokers at thirtyseven and a half cents on their guarantee that it would not be sold by them at less than fortyfive cents </s>
<s> The brokers began getting contracts for the stock and then were told that the Union Securities Company was all sold out </s>
<s> Shortly thereafter confederates of Lyman came to these brokers and offered stock to them at fifty cents a share and the Union Securities Company at the same time telegraphed the brokers that it wanted all the shares it could get at sixty cents </s>
<s> That forced the brokers to buy of confederates but when they shipped on the stock to the Union Securities Company expecting to get sixty cents a share for it Lyman was gone </s>
<s> It had not cost him much </s>
<s> He owed the newspapers of this country 150000 for advertising which went unpaid </s>
<s> He reaped 300000 profits </s>
<s> Boston Greenwater Copper stock can still be found in many a stockingof humble folk </s>
<s> SALTING WITH A CIGARETTE It is not however always the city promoter who furnishes all of the crookedness </s>
<s> He himself may be deceived by those who sell him the mine </s>
<s> Some of the most thrilling stories in literature might be written about salted mines </s>
<s> The sale of the Bear's Nest Mine and the special train expedition to the salted Bear River placer field the sale of the Mulatos Mine to a set of Chinamen and scores of other instances in American mining history have been regarded rather as big jokes than as great lessons </s>
<s> And as to such large jesting we advance in finesse </s>
<s> The old way of salting a placer or a quartz vein with a shotgun is now antiquated </s>
<s> A little while ago a party of capitalists bought a Nevada placer on what they thought to be strictly a cinch basis </s>
<s> With their own hands they collected the specimen dirt from all over the claim and they watched a Mexican miner pan the dirt at the creek </s>
<s> The pans showed up beautifully </s>
<s> They bought the claim </s>
<s> Later it proved worthless </s>
<s> Afterward they remembered that the Mexican smoked cigarettes all the time he was panning and that he was careless in expectorating as well as in knocking the ashes off his cigarettes </s>
<s> The truth was that the highly intelligent Greaser was using the cigarette trick in salting the pan </s>
<s> There was much fine gold in his cigarette and under his lip </s>
<s> THE MULATOS MINE SALTING SCHEME All sorts of methods of salting mines even to the injection with a hypodermic needle of strong solutions of mineral salts into a mining engineer's carefully sealed sample bags have been worked </s>
<s> The most honest careful and expert mining engineers have been deceived time and again and salted right under their own eyes </s>
<s> Even a bland Chinee may be fooled </s>
<s> Take the instance of the Mulatos Mine The bunch of Chinamen who proposed to buy it insisted on a millrun test on freshmined ore taken out BY THEMSELVES for a fivedays' run </s>
<s> They were not taking any chances in their own belief </s>
<s> The owners of the mine howeverso runs the storyhad a platform of plank arranged above the timbers at the top of the drift where the Chinamen brought out their ore cars </s>
<s> On this planking a man lay face downward where he could see each ore car that passed </s>
<s> He had a rather hard life for five days on the sandwiches and water which he took up there with him but he managed to drop a pinch or so of nice gold dust into every car of ore that came trundling under him </s>
<s> The millrun was an entire success from the viewpoint of the sellers although not from that of the buyers </s>
<s> There is no working law let us repeat which actually protects the investor against this sort of thing nor which always protects even the promoter though he be honest </s>
<s> The game is risky all the way along the line in spite of state laws against the heinous crime of salting which latter hath as yet by no means lost its savor </s>
<s> THE MAIL AND MINING THIEVES As matters stand today the man selling mining stock on a fraudulent basis fears the Post Office Department much more than he fears the District Attorney </s>
<s> That is the main protection which the public has against such schemes </s>
<s> But to depend upon it is like trying to stop Niagara with a dam of reeds </s>
<s> The man who induces you to take your money out of the savings bank in exchange for stock in a mine through such operations as have been described thrives by reason of his use of the United States mails </s>
<s> It is a mailorder business pure and simple </s>
<s> Let us see what machinery the Government has to protect you and prevent the lettercarrier from bringing daily to your door the flamboyant literature intended to lure your money from the bank </s>
<s> There are five hundred PostOffice inspectors employed in watching Uncle Sam's mail wherever it is carried in keeping the vast and complicated machinery of the Post Office Department oiled and working smoothly in running down PostOffice robbers and mail thieves and lastly in keeping the mail free from frauds </s>

<s> In the New York district which comprises the state of New York as well as New York City there is a force of twentyfive men working under a chief inspector </s>
<s> Of the ten men assigned to work in New York City by no means all have special detective ability and the time of these is taken up almost entirely in catching actual thieves </s>
<s> POSTOFFICE PROTECTION INADEQUATE It is only the biggest and most barefaced scheme that under these conditions can receive any attention whatsoever from the department and even then its force is hopelessly inadequate and incompetent for the work in hand work requiring the highestclass detective ability </s>
<s> About twelve years ago the Post Office Department ran down and convicted a swindler Stephen Balliet who was selling stock in a mine full of water in Oregon and was known as the mining genius of the Northwest </s>
<s> He was tried three times finally convicted and sent to prison </s>
<s> That case cost the Post Office Department 18000 took a man's entire time for two years and required two trips across this continent </s>
<s> The Government has not tried since to get many such convictions </s>
<s> Perhaps because of the pressure of other work perhaps for other causes investigations of this nature are allowed to languish </s>
<s> Some years ago when the firm of Douglas Lacey & Company was reaping its harvest an inspector was assigned to investigate the concern's operations </s>
<s> He was one of the ablest inspectors of the service a man with real detective ability and a knowledge of the devious ways of certain kinds of financing </s>
<s> He made a trip to Mexico and subsequently sent in a report to Washington recommending that a fraud order be issued against the concern and that its use of the mails be stopped </s>
<s> He waited a long time and then got word from Washington that more evidence was required </s>
<s> He made another investigation and sent in another report recommending in even stronger language that the mails be barred and the public protected </s>
<s> While on this work he was constantly assigned also to other matters and finally was shifted to a station in the South </s>
<s> The concern collapsed some years later leaving thousands of people in this country and in Canada bereft of their small savings </s>
<s> There was no fraud order ever issued against this firm though shortly before it closed up it was informed that if it continued to sell stock its use of the mails would be stopped </s>
<s> The burden of proof is on the buyer </s>
<s> If he turns to the District Attorney he finds perhaps a sympathetic official without power to assist him </s>
<s> The man selling bogus mining stocks knows all this therefore his harvest goes on </s>
<s> It is better than the greengoods game better than the wiretapping swindle safer than selling any other form of gold bricks </s>
<s> A few years ago a reporter who was engaged in investigating the schemes of Cardenio F </s>

<s> Moran then District Attorney in Boston and widely known as a reformer </s>
<s> He asked Mr. Moran's help in proving that King was a swindler </s>
<s> Young man said Boston's reform District Attorney if King was selling corner lots in heaven and advertising them in the newspapers I couldn't stop him because I haven't anybody to send up there and prove that they are not there </s>
<s> King wasn't selling corner lots in heaven but he was selling stock in a Texas company that was the next thing to it so far as tangibility is concerned </s>
<s> It was only when he actually took from investors money sent to him to buy real stocks and pocketed it that he was put in jail </s>

<s> This law has been enacted in six states and a campaign for its general enactment is under way </s>
<s> But let not the credulous investor suppose that even such a law would guarantee him against loss </s>
<s> The Secretary of the American Mining Congress Mr. James F </s>
<s> Callbreath offers the following comment CAMPAIGN OF THE AMERICAN MINING CONGRESS I do not believe that any one law can effect protection to mining investors nor that the protection afforded through the Post Office Department forbidding the use of mails for fraudulent advertising matter can fully cover that ground </s>
<s> The greater part of mining frauds are perpetrated without the use of the mails </s>
<s> The proposed law in our judgment is the longest possible step toward preventing mining frauds </s>
<s> A second step has been taken in the form of a publicity law </s>
<s> My belief is that no system of laws either state or national will prevent men from gambling in mines more effectually than such laws now prevent gambling in its more common forms </s>
<s> These may restrict and furnish protection to those who are wise enough to open their eyes but it will be impossible to protect all the fools all the time </s>
<s> It is the purpose of the American Mining Congress after having secured the enactment of laws providing penalties for fraudulent representations and requiring publicity to perfect an organization to SECURE EXECUTION of these laws and also to carry on campaigns of education showing to investors first that mining is a legitimate business and not a gamble second that mines are found and not made third that investments in mining should be made with the same care and prudence exercised by business men when embarking in other business enterprises </s>
<s> . . . The next work of our organization will be along the line of developing some manner of control of corporations by which paidup capital stock shall represent actual value </s>
<s> Mr. Callbreath would seem to be one foredoomed to his own troubles yet it is clear that he and his organization stand for legitimate mining as opposed to prospectselling </s>
<s> In strictly accurate phrase it is the prospect which is found and the mine which is made and investment cannot properly begin until a body of ore has been blocked out in a proved prospect </s>
<s> Add to the glamor of risk the haze of fraud and the foregoing will show the nebulous condition of mining investments in relation to mining laws in America today </s>
<s> What we really need is a Bureau of Mines at Washington </s>
<s> Nobody protects the mining investor </s>
<s> Nobody guards the widest open gate into the savings deposits of this country </s>
<s> The American Mining Congress it should be stated had a quasi preinaugural pledge from President Taft in favor of a Federal Bureau of Mines </s>
<s> Toward this we have made a start </s>
<s> A bill establishing this Bureau has already passed both the House and the Senate and bids fair to become a law </s>
<s> But the activities of this new department will be confined to safeguarding mineworkers </s>
<s> The next step should be to enlarge the province of the Bureau so as to include the supervision of the mining industry for the protection of investors </s>
<s> It seems quite likely that the states and the nation will need to unite if adequate protection to the investing public is to be expected </s>
<s> But when did state and nation unite to solve a great popular problem </s>
<s> When did section ever unite with section or even resident with nonresident </s>
<s> This is America </s>
<s> THE ENGLISH WAY OF MININGHONEST BUSINESS Back of any movement of this kind there must be popular interest in popular education </s>
<s> Thus far the greater publicity idea is of more value than anything at hand </s>
<s> We may perhaps </s>
<s> best do our own little part by offering some studies in the theory of mining showing just WHY it is risky and just HOW we ought to tabulate the risk </s>
<s> In addition to this we can present and should perhaps first present some of the results of intelligent mining as pursued in other countries </s>
<s> Take the Rand Mines of South Africa operated on the English basismines which turned out more than 12500000 in one month not long since </s>
<s> The English method of operating on the Rand is this A corps of experts is sent to examine a proposed propertythat is to say a proved prospect </s>
<s> If their report be favorable an estimate is made of the cost of a fiveor sevencompartment shaft to be sunk say 3500 feet </s>
<s> The cost of producing a year's supply of ore for the mill is then considered </s>
<s> The cost of the mill and the cyanide plant is also figured </s>
<s> The total cost is then cast up and the company is ready to be formed for a half million to five millions of dollars according to existing conditions </s>
<s> This money is paid in and is ready to start operations </s>
<s> These men mine carefully using all possible scientific knowledge and practical experience as guides </s>
<s> The operation may have risk but it is perforce honest </s>
<s> THE AMERICAN WAYA GAMBLE Now let us examine conditions not infrequent in the United States by no means assigning wings to all English mining men or hoofs to all Americans A prospector discovers mineralized rock </s>
<s> He locates one or more claims as controlled by the laws of the district where he is </s>
<s> Perhaps others also locate more ground </s>
<s> A little work is done and then the claims are up for sale </s>
<s> A claim is perhaps sold for a few hundred to several thousand dollars sometimes the seller receives in addition stock in the company to be formed </s>
<s> No attention is paid to the geology but a company is formed ostensibly for the purpose of mining with a capital of one million shares at one dollar par </s>
<s> Perhaps four hundred thousand shares are placed in the treasury to be sold for development purposes </s>
<s> Of course the whole thing is as yet on a wholly gambling basis </s>
<s> The property is still a prospect and not a mine and hence it is not possible to put it on an investing basis </s>
<s> Comparatively few companies have ever used the services of a real expert although very possibly the company furnishes a report made from a purchasable local mining engineer one of the cheapest commodities in any mining district where the wide hat and the highlaced boot often take the place of a mining education and a reputable character </s>
<s> This is the stage at which this is the basis on which most of the mining investments of America are made </s>
<s> In this state of affairs grafters find their opportunity </s>
<s> Prices in a boom camp are always above any sort of industrial warrant </s>
<s> There were literally millions of dollars poured into Goldfield and Tonopah for claims which never had any careful examination by competent men </s>
<s> Fortunes were made by local promoters and operators out of claims which could not show ten feet of actual work </s>
<s> Sometimes the entire capitalization was sold out and the promoters put the money in their pockets </s>
<s> One operator of this kind sold 130000 worth of stock and omitted the precaution of putting even ten per cent </s>
<s> of it in the treasury </s>
<s> Fortunately he got into the penitentiary </s>
<s> Many of his fellows never had actions brought against them except under the postal laws which naturally are inefficient </s>
<s> There was one shaft of a hundred feet which cost twelve thousand dollars charged up to the stockholders the names of dead men being used on the pay rolls as laborers </s>
<s> The mine boss and the local officers got big salaries to keep their mouths shut </s>
<s> The real mine was in the savings banks of America in the pockets of nonresidents </s>
<s> In Nevada alone in the past four years more than twenty million dollars have been invested in WORTHLESS properties </s>
<s> One engineer with a government certificate could have saved the clerks stenographers widows washwomen and orphans of America fifteen million dollars at the cost of say five thousand </s>
<s> Would that have been a good investment </s>
<s> What could a dozen do </s>
<s> What could an efficient corps do </s>
<s> Is there here yet one more future task for our patient and longsuffering United States Army </s>
<s> What police work would pay better dividends </s>
<s> THE PROMOTER AND THE CREAM Even when the mine wins the small stockholder rarely wins </s>
<s> The promoters often take the cream </s>
<s> Suppose a company is organized for three million shares </s>
<s> One million is put in the treasury for sale </s>
<s> Of this million shares say two hundred thousand are offered at twentyfive cents </s>
<s> This raises a working capital of fifty thousand dollars </s>
<s> Let us be very glowing and suppose that with this fifty thousand dollars we really uncover five million dollars' worth of ore </s>
<s> The net profit would not exceed three million dollars so that the man who put in twentyfive cents might after a long time get back a dollar </s>
<s> In the meantime two million dollars would have gone to promoters in commissions and so forth </s>
<s> There are thousands of such cases and still the people continue to bite on such bait </s>
<s> THE PUBLIC THE MINE Instances of actual Nipissing rises caught in time by the lamb are very rare </s>
<s> I rom first to last the PUBLIC is the mine AND THE RETURNS COME OUT OF THE SAVINGS BANKS </s>
<s> In some mines high gradingthe carrying away of valuable pieces of ore by the miners themselvesis fought as sternly as the diamond stealing by the Kaffirs in a Kimberley mine </s>
<s> In yet other mines far more numerous high grading is encouraged among the miners </s>
<s> The report gets out that the ore is so rich that the miners steal it in their dinner pails </s>
<s> That booms the stock </s>
<s> WALL STREET MAKES THIS MONEY OUT OF THE MARKET AND NOT OUT OF THE MINE </s>
<s> In spite of all warning and all examples the average American will to a certain extent persist in gambling in mining stocks </s>
<s> Supposing this to be true it is of value for the investor to learn something of the theory of mines something enabling him to pass on the natural value of any mining stock which is offered to him </s>
<s> What then is a mine </s>
<s> What are some of the inevitable features in developing a mine </s>
<s> In the first place there must be prospecting </s>
<s> This is sheer and unavoidable risk on the face of it and it is attended with economic waste which cannot be avoided </s>
<s> Of a hundred prospectors ninetynine die poor </s>
<s> The failures must be charged off to industrial waste attendant upon inherent conditions of the mining industry </s>
<s> Again in the development of a mine after it is located and proved in part there is more unavoidable economic waste </s>
<s> The rock is blank and silent </s>
<s> It can only be explored by means of expensive drifts and drillings </s>
<s> In one mine at Bisbee Arizona a shaft was sunk which had drifts at the 600and 900feet levels all without result </s>
<s> Later on they found a blanket of copper between those two levels from which six million dollars were taken </s>
<s> Even in old established mines there is something of a chance and there are often unwittingly false standards of values </s>
<s> Which is no argument for making all gamble that which originally was part gamble </s>
<s> Any mine no matter how rich or how large begins to be exhausted from the time the first pick is stuck into the ground and all its profits ought to be figured on the basis of diminishing deposits </s>
<s> When your deposit is drawn out your bank does not honor your check </s>
<s> A mine is the reverse of a mortgage or a bond </s>
<s> The security does not remain stable nor increase in value but on the contrary CONTINUALLY DECREASES in value </s>
<s> In a mortgage six per cent </s>
<s> is wisdom in a mining return it is folly </s>
<s> A mine instead of being figured on the basis of a mortgage ought to be figured on the basis of a term annuity </s>
<s> That is to say on the basis of a wiping out date </s>
<s> When the mine is done paying dividends there is no return of the face of the principal invested </s>
<s> Yet the great and gullible public forgets this allimportant fact which differentiates mining from every other form of business </s>
<s> CRACKERBOX INVESTORS There is every probability that the average investor never heard of a proper amortization charge in the management of a mine </s>
<s> Until he shall have heard of it until he shall have learned something of the terms of life annuities he ought never to invest a cent in any mining stock </s>
<s> After he actually has learned the theory of amortization he will observe that ALMOST EVERY MINING STOCK LISTED IN PUBLIC PRINTS IS SELLING AT AN INFLATED VALUE </s>
<s> That is to say even the best and most stable of mines are overrated not to mention the purely wildcat ventures </s>
<s> Some mines may naturally be longlived others shortlived yet if either pays a good stiff dividend THE PUBLIC MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TWO and will buy the stock of either </s>
<s> In this investing the public has no protection on the part of the government on the part of honest publicity or on the part of its own careful education </s>
<s> In the MAJORITY of cases a mine ought to pay annually perhaps twenty per cent </s>
<s> of the investment to be profitable </s>
<s> That is to say the actual value of any mine is rarely over five times actual dividends paid after expenses of operation </s>
<s> How many mines are capitalized on any such real basis as that </s>
<s> The answer lies in our own ignorance and in the shrewdness of the men who sell us mining stocks </s>
<s> Stocks that are the best dividendpayers often sell at TEN or TWELVE times the face of the annual dividends </s>
<s> Let the mine hit a brief streak of bonanza and the stocks will climb yet higher </s>
<s> We buy such stocks or worse but even a fundamental acquaintance with the theory of mines would show us that such an investment is usually a bad one </s>
<s> In a mortgage we do not look to the interest to pay us back our principal in a mine we MUST look to DIVIDENDS to pay us back our PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST also </s>
<s> When the mine is done our principal is gone </s>
<s> But how many mining investors ever thought of that </s>
<s> And how many when offered a ten per cent </s>
<s> guaranteed dividend for five years on their money ever stop to reflect that for instance I could take your money and put it in a cracker box and myself make money by paying it back to you ten per cent </s>
<s> a year for nine yearsand then explaining what had happened to the cracker box </s>
<s> Now most of us are just such crackerbox investors </s>
<s> We pay out millions and millions annually just that foolishly </s>
<s> And our nation our states allow us to do it </s>
<s> They evenas recent legal proceedings proveallow the inside operating stockholders to borrow money to pay dividends to the outsiders </s>
<s> That keeps up the values in the market </s>
<s> It does not enhance the real value in the mine </s>
<s> ENGLISH VS. AMERICAN MINE REPORTS Again granted even a valid and a wellmanaged mine how much information regarding it does the average investor in the stock secure </s>
<s> In a general way he knows in advance that all mining whether placer or quartz is very expensive </s>
<s> Beyond that he gets the annual report of the officers which will tell perhaps the names of the men who are spending his money the total earnings the total output the balance sheet the statement of capital stock issuedand little else </s>
<s> All of which means nothing </s>
<s> A wellregulated English company is obliged to go much farther than this </s>
<s> A good annual report will show the advertisement of the general meeting of stockholders the list of directors and officers reports of directors giving details of the condition of property including the development work the tonnage of production the values recovered from such tonnage the costs of operation the profits for the period covered the balance sheet of accounts the profit and loss statement including a working cost estimate the appropriation list showing what has been done with all the earnings the reports of managers giving details of the development work the estimated values of ores EXPOSED ON THREE SIDES the probable values of ores not so well exposed the working expenses the construction account general remarks on the physical condition of the property and a map of the property itself </s>
<s> What American promoter would trouble himself to make such a showing as that to the American sucker </s>
<s> Even if such detailed information existed in the records of the average American mining concern the sucker could not get access to the books even did he have the temerity to demand it </s>
<s> Professor H </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Munroe of the Columbia School of Mines when asked whether such a thing as general supervision of mining investment could be possible answered Yes if some philanthropist will give us ten millions to endow such an institution and maintain a corps of engineers in the field who will do work similar to that accomplished by J </s>
<s> Curle under the auspices of the London Economist </s>
<s> Such work should of course cover all incorporated mining companies not merely a few hundred of the more prominent gold mines and it should be continuous and not spasmodic </s>
<s> Such a plan is of course Utopian but I feel that anything less would be likely to do little good </s>
<s> Even Curle's opinions began to lose their value within a month or two after they were written and are of less value every year </s>
<s> Mining can never be put on the same basis as agriculture for the reason that the risk of failure is infinitely greater and that it is impossible to prove the value of any mine or mining region without spending a large amount of capital the greater part of which will inevitably be lost in this work of initial development </s>
<s> Those are the sober words of an expert who spends his life in studying the theory and practice of mining </s>
<s> If such words shall teach us a little wisdom so much the less need for laws </s>
<s> But let us consider what the laws ought to do in order to protect you for the sake of your family and for the sake of society and for the sake of the savings which lie back of the prosperity of this country </s>
<s> Let us agree that no government can guarantee the safety of any investment </s>
<s> Let us admit that digging gold can never be put on the same amortization basis with digging potatoes for instance because the soil remains for more potatoes whereas the ore of a mine is exhausted and does not raise more ore </s>
<s> Nevertheless although the industries of potato growing and ore digging are not the same the principles lying back of them ought to be precisely the same and our governments both state and national ought to see to it that they are kept precisely the same and controlled on the same plane legally </s>
<s> If it be true that no government can watch after every mine none the less any enlightened government can establish general conditions for engaging in mining or engaging in the sale of mining stock and perhaps with yet better results it can establish a general supervision over the mining intelligence of the public just as it does over the agricultural intelligence of that public </s>
<s> NEEDED A FEDERAL BUREAU OF MINES The enactment of good mining laws punishing the proved intent to commit a fraud as well as the fraud itself and seeing to it that capital stock shall be paid up seeing to it also that all moneys spent by a mining corporation shall be traceable from start to finish is the natural first step toward the purification of American mining methods </s>
<s> Beyond that the national government could take a hand in the game through a federal Bureau of Mines </s>
<s> There must be some clearinghouse of intelligence and of values in this country some place from which our intelligence may start and to which it may return </s>
<s> The public must have accessible reports of engineers state or federal of a sort entitled to confidence </s>
<s> The nest of vermin in our large cities inhabited by those who make a living out of the ignorance and eagerness of small investors must be smoked out once and for all </s>
<s> In this work state and national governments popular education and intelligence and the aid of the better class journalism of America all must be enlisted </s>
<s> The pages of our press might well be far cleaner than they are </s>
<s> The publication which prints the advertisements of a fakemining enterprise is itself a party to the fraud </s>
<s> A Bureau of Mines chief can sit behind the desk of every advertising manager in the countingrooms of every newspaper and magazine in America </s>
<s> The press of this country when it likes can by taking thought somewhat dim the splendor of the mahogany in many an elegant suite of offices in New York Boston or elsewhere </s>
<s> It can reduce the reckless and senseless expenditure of illgained wealth which is making civilization a mockery in America and branding our republican form of government as a failure </s>
<s> We will have a different way of life or another form of government </s>
<s> We will have a better administration of law in the United States or we will have another political party possibly another political system </s>
<s> We will clear up this rotten society or we will try how we like a different organization of society </s>
<s> The people of America are beginning to murmur </s>
<s> The burden of the murmur is that they have long enough been betrayed </s>
<s> Unspeakable injustice has been done the people of America under the forms of law and government </s>
<s> It is coming to be said that our law and government have not an even hand for all that a few are allowed to despoil the many </s>
<s> When a people murmurs let a government beware </s>
<s> Meantime the more that certain unspeakable things are reduced in and eliminated from Wall Street and the other financial centers the better for our schools our taxes our farming our industry our living our CHARACTER our country </s>
<s> After all the government of this country as we now have it organized depends on the CHARACTER of its average individual citizen </s>
<s> The end of this abuse of fakemining enterprises begins now here with you and me in OUR intelligence in OUR love of a square game </s>
<s> By taking thought we can add a cubit to our OWN stature and so add to the stature of OUR laws and of our national morality </s>
<s> WHAT YOU AND I CAN DO As for you and me when next we see the flaming advertisement advising us that the Madre d'Oro Montezuma's fabled Mother Vein of Gold has once more come to the surface of the earth on Manhattan Island or near Plymouth Rock when next we read counsel that because mining pays in Michigan it ought to pay in Nevada when next we are advised to get into the game at once because this is our LAST CHANCEwe might at least ask to see the report of the engineer likewise the record and antecedents of the engineer and many many other things </s>
<s> Perchance we might write and ask the mining promoter what in his belief is the proper amortization charge in his particular mine </s>

<s> Vol. XXIII No.1 JULY 1910 HOW THE MAN CAME TO TWINKLING ISLAND page 6473 By MELVILLE CHATER OUT of the great world came a man to the wooing of Susanna Crane </s>
<s> From the vague southwest he came now skirting the chimneyed towns and elmbordered village streets now exchanging the road for the bright rails and perhaps the interior of a droning freightcar now switching anew through the edge of odorous pine woods yet leaving behind him always a wary broken trail </s>
<s> The man was tall and strong with hair that gleamed red in the sun and eyes of a reddish brown </s>
<s> He walked with the free swing of a world wanderer yet always his heart strained for a glimpse of the Canadian border for some hundreds of miles behind him lay the Vermont marble quarries whose dust still faintly blanched his clothes and there in a drunken flight he had killed a man </s>
<s> He did not know that in fleeing from justice he was rushing into the arms of love he did not even know that he was in the Ragged Woods with Twinkling Island just off the coast he only studied the tree bark and snuffed the breeze and knew that the sea was near </s>
<s> At length well satisfied with the distance he had come since dawn he cleared a space among the pine cones then lay down and lulled by the ancient whisper of the wind in the treetops closed his eyes </s>
<s> He was of the Ulysses breed this man a wanderer of the earth acquainted with many cities one whose shipwrecks and misfortunes had but whetted his love of life and even while he slept there came upon him as of old Nausicaa came upon Ulysses a woman </s>
<s> She too was straight and strong her dark face was framed by a bluechecked sunbonnet she carried a large basket filled with blackberries and her lips as well as her hands were stained </s>
<s> She saw the man lying in a shaft of the sunset and started back then tiptoeing past bent forward slightly to examine his face </s>
<s> In that lingering gaze a twig cracked beneath her foot </s>
<s> He sat up instantly tense expectant then for a silent space their eyes caught and clung </s>
<s> Thus the first pair might have gazed when Adam wakened to find her who was bone of his bone flesh of his flesh standing over him </s>
<s> Did I scare you Miss </s>
<s> at length asked the Man </s>
<s> I thoughtwell I didn't know who you might be at first </s>
<s> His gaze deepened into unconcealed admiration </s>
<s> I wouldn't scare YOU for anything </s>
<s> I ain't so easy scairt the girl returned defiantly </s>

<s> To this she vouchsafed nothing but swung onward shifting her heavy basket from one hand to the other then a strong grasp intervened and she found herself burdenless </s>
<s> In the village streets of Potuck and Nogantic shamefaced lads had offered such help a hundred times and she had accepted it flattered by their homage but the quick silent action of this big redhaired man thrilled her with strange anger </s>

<s> ALL right chiquita mia </s>
<s> Never you mind me Little Peachey </s>
<s> They gained a bare tongue of land lapped by water </s>

<s> But even as the great Ulysses was wont to name a false lineage and give a feigned story to his hosts so this man said his name was McFarlanewhich it was notand told a wily tale of having been directed to a logging camp where hands were needed of alighting at the wrong station and losing his way in an attempted short cut through the woods </s>

<s> 'Pears to give 'em a kind o' satisfaction to set a man to work </s>
<s> Her mother was just the same before her </s>
<s> The guest said nothing but the realization that the girl who had grudged his taking her basket had afterward suffered him to carry her canoe quite an unnecessary distance seemed to yield him no unpleasant thoughts </s>
<s> They sat down to supper in a low'ceiled room of smoked rafters </s>
<s> The stranger ate hungrily and with few words yet always his gaze followed the girl's slim figure as she moved to and fro waiting on the board </s>

<s> Now was the Man's heart loosened and he told of all he had seen and done and lived of his spendthrift youth passed aboard tramp freighters between Lisbon and Rio Leith and Natal Tokyo Melbourne and the Golden Gatewherever the sea ran green of ginsenggrowing in China shellac gathering in India cattlegrazing in Wyoming </s>
<s> He spoke of Alaskan totempoles of Indian sign language of Aztec monoliths buried in the forest </s>
<s> He sang Lather an' Shavin's La Golondrina The Cowboy's Lament and clicking his fingers castanetwise hummed little Spanish airs whose words he would by no means translate </s>
<s> Crane marveled that this man should be still on the hitherward side of thirty and as the stranger sat there his very clothes poor rags of civilization seemed to bulk with heroic lines his face to reflect man's primal freedom while his every word rang with the sheer joy of the things he had seen and known </s>
<s> At a break in the talk the girl who though she had constantly busied herself about the room had missed not a word nodded significantly to her father then walked from the house and out into the night </s>
<s> He glanced after her for a moment then turned with a queer smile </s>
<s> We're all 'baout the same I reckon he said so far as furren countries is consarned </s>
<s> That's to say a man allaways conceits thar's a heap o' promise waitin' for him somewhar over yonder </s>
<s> Naow you've seen sights enough for a hundred men </s>
<s> Contrariwise thar's my galnever been further'n the Caounty Fair </s>
<s> But that don't stop her no sirree human nature can't be stopped </s>
<s> Every night fair or storm she walks daown an' sits on the rocks lookin' seaward before she turns in </s>
<s> She's done it ever since she was SO high </s>
<s> Why thar's nothin' to see but the Atlantic an' a piece o' foreland to the northwest </s>
<s> But her fancy is the sea's abringin' her somethin'that's what she used to say as a kidsomethin' she don't rightly know what </s>
<s> _I_ say it's just furren countriespieces she's got outer story books an' yarns she's heard the fishermen tellthat's what's she's hankerin' for Mr. McFarlane </s>
<s> So ye see as I say we're all 'baout the same that way </s>
<s> When I first seen her began the Man tentatively I could ha' sworn thatSee here now </s>
<s> Ain't thar still the leavin's of a redskin outfit up this way </s>
<s> Why yes returned the other with some compunction </s>
<s> I don't talk much 'baout itnot that it's a thing to he ashamed of but I wouldn't give the gal a handle to think herself different from any one else hereabout </s>
<s> The truth is her mother's mother was pretty near to a fullblooded Ojibwaynot the kind you've seen plaitin' baskets for summer boarders but a clean straightbacked red woman an' she claimed descent from one o' their big chiefs </s>
<s> I'm English stock myself but the wild breed mixes slow it's in her blood Mr. McFarlane and sometimes it worrits me </s>
<s> Thar's days she won't speak nor eat but just goes off to the woods an' makes little trinkets out o' pine needles an' bark and then I know the fit's on her </s>
<s> And proud </s>
<s> Thar's not a man hereabout she'd lift an eye at and one feller that wouldn't take no got his head split open with an oar </s>
<s> Sometimes I've thought that ef she was married to a strong manstrong AND kind d'ye see?'twould be the best thing for her </s>
<s> At this the stranger who had missed no word leaned quickly forward the firelight striking his firm face </s>
<s> With the poise of conscious power he said quite simply I'm the man </s>
<s> They eyed each other a moment Crane measuring the Man who had come the Man inviting measurement </s>
<s> You mean </s>
<s> asked the father </s>
<s> He paused as if welcoming interruption but it was not in this man's slow sure nature to interrupt </s>
<s> Tell us what you do mean </s>
<s> I mean repeated the other slowly that I'M THE MAN </s>
<s> I love that little gal I want to marry her </s>
<s> O' course you objeck that's natural that's right </s>
<s> I like your objectin' an' I'm going to fight it to a showdown </s>
<s> First you'll say `You're verrucktcrazy.' See hyar now </s>
<s> I've lived life I have and I've seen a drove o' women hither an' yon but not one of 'em could hold me no more'n an ordinary slipknot could hold stuff on a packsaddle </s>
<s> I'm no lightweight an' I need the diamond hitch </s>
<s> But today when I seen Little Peachey in the scrub over yonder why it was different and I knowed it right quick </s>
<s> Ever broke a horse have you </s>
<s> Well before you've got your lassoo coiled the critter's eyes'll tell you just what sort o' teaparty you're goin' to have </s>
<s> Thar was a man oncea hoss wrangleran' the easier a hoss broke the more he'd mouch around an' hang his head real melancholy and sadeyed </s>
<s> The only minutes o' slapbangup joy that came his way was when he corralled a bucker whose natural ability to roll on him an' kick his brains out left no percentage o' chance in the player's favor </s>
<s> Maybe that's what I seen in Little Peachey today </s>
<s> Just now you said the wild breed mixes slow </s>
<s> It does for it sticks out waitin' for its own kind </s>
<s> And by that same token blood talks to bloodaye even without no Indian signlanguage </s>
<s> Maybe all these years Little Peachey settin' out on them rocks has been awatchin' for more than foreign countries </s>
<s> Aye mebbe that's all right </s>
<s> Crane paced the floor and his voice rose savagely Don't know but what your palaver mightn't win plenty o' foolish gals </s>
<s> But who are ye </s>
<s> What's your trade </s>
<s> Whar's your folks </s>
<s> Thar's lots o' rogues afoot </s>
<s> Do you allow I'd let the first stranger in Ragged Woods talk marriage to my daughter </s>
<s> What have you said </s>
<s> What's between you </s>
<s> Out with it or I'll have you in Rockledge Jail by tomorrow morning </s>
<s> The Man who had come nodded response with imperturbable gravity </s>
<s> I like your talk he said </s>
<s> It comes straight off the hip an' it calls for a straight answer </s>
<s> What have I spoke to her </s>
<s> Nothin' </s>
<s> What's between us </s>
<s> Nothin' but the makin's </s>
<s> Next touchin' myself Since sixteen I've been kickin' up the dust o' the earth till my home is anywhar immediately convenient </s>
<s> Once I had a brother in New Orleans another in the Northwest and another who drank himself accidentally into the British army an' died in the Sudan </s>
<s> We were wanderers the lot of us </s>
<s> I'm ScotchIrish and my old mother used to claim we harked back to the kings o' some outfit I've forgotten </s>
<s> But bloodfacts is no more proof than specimens from an unprospected claim </s>
<s> Friends </s>
<s> I make 'em everywhar any one on the top o' the earth who's got the makin's of a man kin call me friend </s>
<s> Yet right here an' now I wouldn't touch the twelve apostles for an assay on my character </s>
<s> 'Cause why </s>
<s> 'Cause I hold that just like a man lays in his own little square o' earth so a man stands alone on his own little piece o' reputation </s>
<s> Good or bad friends or no friends it's his'n and the Almighty files a pretty good chart of it right on his face </s>
<s> I want you to size me up accordingly </s>
<s> Again the father gazed deeply at the Man who had come and again the Man gave him the full of his eyes </s>
<s> Crane's glance shifted suspiciously from the other's face to the decanter and back again the Man immediately responded by lifting his glass </s>
<s> Fill that up three times raw he said and I'll swaller it in three breaths just to show you what a drink IS </s>
<s> No sir it's hot your picayune drop o' spirits that's talkin'it's me </s>
<s> Acabado </s>
<s> Finished </s>
<s> And tossing the contents of his glass into the fire he replaced it upside down on the table </s>
<s> Yes said Crane wonderingly you're soberand you're honest </s>
<s> You certainly are honest </s>
<s> He paused as if to steel himself </s>
<s> But what o' that </s>
<s> Why should you come between me and my child in one night after these twenty years we've spentwe've spent Simultaneously his words failed and his shoulders drooped </s>
<s> See here now Stay along and work for me awhile </s>
<s> I'll give you half shares in the boat </s>
<s> But just wait wait awhile </s>
<s> Some day you'll speak to her about it and thenthen mebbe I'll see it different </s>
<s> But the Man rose restively </s>
<s> It comes hard on you he mused aye mighty hard but it ain't all my doin' Mr. Crane nor yet Little Peachey's </s>
<s> It's something bigger'n the lot of us it's nature </s>
<s> You might as well put your back up against a landslide </s>
<s> As to stayin' on here 'tain't in me I must hit the trail tomorrow morning </s>
<s> But tonight thar's somethin' in hereand he struck his breastthat won't keep it's got to be said </s>
<s> I've spoken my little piece an' you say you size me for a man </s>
<s> Bien </s>
<s> Bein' a man I take no favors </s>
<s> No sir I ain't no emptyhanded brave </s>
<s> Little Peachey bein' the squaw for me an' I havin' told you so an' smoked your tobacco an' drunk your whisky I hereby deliver </s>
<s> He drew out a roll of bills and tossed them upon the table observing whimsically Two hundred an' thirtyodd dollars honestly come by an' all the estate real or otherwise whereof I stand possessed </s>
<s> Money talks </s>
<s> Take it it's yours </s>
<s> An' now I'm goin' to find Little Peachey </s>
<s> He strode out into the night and toward the forelands his ears guided by the monotonous crash and moan of the long Atlantic swell </s>
<s> Standing on the cliff was a windfluttered figure that turned at the sound of his step with eyes defiantly alert </s>
<s> You knew I'd come he said simply drawing close to her </s>
<s> Peachey little Peachey what's them waves asayin' to the rocks </s>
<s> It's `ME </s>
<s> YOU </s>
<s> ME </s>
<s> YOU!' Ain't they always been asayin' it </s>
<s> Kin you stop 'em little Peachey </s>
<s> And that's the words I'm astandin' here now fer to say to you </s>
<s> I ain't agoin' to listen she cried sharply drawing back </s>
<s> I don't want none o' your words </s>
<s> You just leave me alone now MisterMister Why names don't count between us chiquita said he with his greathearted smile </s>
<s> I'm just a man I am an' you're just a woman and rightly I don't know no name for the thing that's been acallin' between us ever since I seen you in the woods </s>
<s> But I kin see it in your face Peachey an' you kin see it in mine it's alookin' at me through them eyes o' yourn Don't you look at me </s>
<s> she cried flinging an arm across her face </s>
<s> I hate you youMan </s>
<s> Don't you come near me naow </s>
<s> I hate you I could kill you </s>
<s> But he only smiled down upon her kindly understandingly </s>
<s> That's what the father saidaye or somethin' mighty like it but I told him I wrastled with him till he savvied </s>
<s> Andmakin' no secrets between us PeacheyI paid him two hundred dollars down to call it quits </s>
<s> Why what's a few dollars </s>
<s> They don't cut no figure between you and me 'cause I love you little Peachey an' I know right down in your heart you love me too </s>
<s> His voice quivered deeply as he drew near and laid his hands on her shoulders </s>
<s> Instantly she raised her face and their glances met in one quick flare </s>
<s> He felt her shiver in his grasp like some panicstricken animal then she turned and fled from him </s>
<s> He followed calling after her to stop yet the lust of the chase swelled within him and he knew he but loved this woman the more that she was not lying tamed within his arm </s>
<s> Breasting the house he saw that she had swerved toward the island's long leeward neck from whence there was thrown a narrow pilebridge connecting it with the mainland </s>
<s> His feet rang on the planks as she gained the opposite shore and his heart laughed with joy for he divined the instinct that had called her not to her father's side but to the mysterious heart of the woods </s>
<s> Now he felt beneath him the soft pad of pine needles little twigs switched his face and warm odorous airs breathed their welcome </s>
<s> Through the dimness he saw her gain the crest of a ridge running lightly with long strides and as he reached the spot from the hollow beneath there rang her voice flung back in mocking laughter </s>
<s> By the trail's wide curve and the shelving land he perceived that they were skirting the edge of inland waters more than this he knew nothing save that through vista after vista mile by mile her flying feet beckoned him onward and that her heart was singing to his the last wild defiance of the almostwon </s>
<s> At a sharp turn he came suddenly upon a cleared space shoring along the water's edge lit by a blazing campfire </s>
<s> Within the circle of the glow she stood a spent panting figure half supported by two men </s>
<s> A huntingdog dashed forward menacing the oncomer with stiffened back and bared teeth </s>
<s> The man strode into the group and said with quiet courtesy Good evening gentlemen </s>
<s> I am glad you rounded her up for both consarned </s>
<s> Peachey my hat's off to you an' all your tribe you'd have run till you dropped </s>
<s> I see gentlemen that you're sizin' me up which is natural an' gratifyin' </s>
<s> But things is square an' satisfactory between me and her I do assure you </s>
<s> The younger of the twoa tall keenfaced man of citybred appearanceturned to the girl and said with irritation I don't understand </s>
<s> What does he mean </s>
<s> Are you his wife </s>
<s> She was leaning against a tree her face averted </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> she panted vehemently </s>
<s> No no </s>
<s> Tell yer it's Crane's gal insisted the second man </s>
<s> They live over yonder on the island </s>
<s> I pointed it aout acomin' through the woods the day you landed up here Mr. Hemsley </s>
<s> Have you any claim on this girl </s>
<s> demanded Hemsley wheeling upon the stranger </s>
<s> Touchin' claims returned the other with sure emphasis I am not for filin' mine with the first party immediately convenient </s>
<s> The claim is filed O </s>
<s> K </s>
<s> elsewhere and at present as you're prospectin' on the hither side o' my line I'll put one straight question to you Did or did not Little Peachey ask you for protection </s>
<s> Why no retorted Hemsley a trifle confused she didn'tnot in so many words </s>
<s> He turned to the girl </s>
<s> Who is this man </s>
<s> Tell me everything you needn't be afraid Miss Crane </s>
<s> I'm not afraid </s>
<s> she flashed sullenly </s>
<s> He was alayin' in Ragged Woods this afternoon an' he carried my berry basket home an' stayed to supper </s>
<s> And afterward he caught hold o' me he did an' tried to kiss me an' I ran away 'cause'cause I hate him </s>
<s> I hate him </s>
<s> Her shrill cry ended in a passionate gesture </s>
<s> Wheeling she marched down the slope to the water's edge where she stood looking out into the night </s>
<s> All at once the man threw his face up to the sky and burst into a great roar of laughter </s>
<s> Right you are Little Peachey </s>
<s> he called </s>
<s> Thar ain't no more to be said than thatjust you an' me in the Ragged Woods at sundown </s>
<s> An' nowBlessed if we ain't downright stampeded </s>
<s> It's a reg'lar roundup Peachey </s>
<s> And he laughed again uncontrollably </s>
<s> Well said Hemsley at length I don't like the looks of things and I'm going to make it my business to take Miss Crane home to her father </s>
<s> I advise you not to make any trouble until you've proved who you are </s>
<s> Rockledge County Jail is only six miles away </s>
<s> The other sobered to a statue then turned regarding Hemsley with mild fixity </s>
<s> Gentlemen he said gentlemen both </s>
<s> I ain't askin' for your help and as far as I can see neither is Peachey </s>
<s> I mean it </s>
<s> Gentlemen a mule is a most onsafe critter </s>
<s> Even when you go to his funeral you'll do well to sit at the head of the coffin </s>
<s> Then all three turned quickly for there had arisen from below the sound of a grating keel </s>
<s> That settles it said Hemsley with dry satisfaction </s>
<s> Miss Crane has gone home in the canoe </s>
<s> So much the better I'm not looking for trouble </s>
<s> And he turned away </s>
<s> But the Man gave one great laugh then he was off like a shot down the slope and into the water </s>
<s> At shoulderdepth he overtook the canoe and clung to its stern </s>
<s> Go up forward Little Peachey he cried an' sit mighty still till I swing in else we'll be swimmin' in another minute </s>
<s> There </s>
<s> And drawing himself up over the stern he seized the paddle while the canoe leaped forward beneath his powerful strokes </s>
<s> From somewhere along the shore came the sound of voices but the campfire blazed deserted </s>
<s> Gradually its light diminished to a twinkling spark in the blackness </s>
<s> For a while no word was spoken the man bending to his task the girl crouching with averted face in the extreme bow </s>
<s> Then a little new moon peered over the distant pine tops the heavens spread their starry veil and the hour of Susanna Crane's wooing had come </s>
<s> Me </s>
<s> You </s>
<s> intoned the Man to the sweep of his paddle </s>
<s> Me </s>
<s> You </s>
<s> That's what the waves were sayin' that's what you kep' acallin' to me through the woods that's what the stars are writin' on the skyMe </s>
<s> You </s>
<s> Big Chief oh you heap Big Chief somewhar up yonder ain't you l'arned me some things this day </s>
<s> Peachey me and another man down in the marble quarries got fightin' in liquor an' he drew a gun on me an' I killed him with it </s>
<s> Then I got away quick and carelesslike but the Big Chief he leads me up here an' sets me in the woods an' sends you along the trail </s>
<s> An' while I'm lyin' thar asleep He tells me in a dream `You proud man </s>
<s> You unbroke bucker </s>
<s> Maybe you kin kill a man but I've got my own good way o' tamin' you and bringin' you home.' Blood for blood I thought He meant but I wakes up andQue gracia!thar you stands </s>
<s> And your face it says to me `Come on you wicked redhanded man </s>
<s> God's acallin'.' And I says to myself real sudden like I was at a camp meetin' `Praise God!' Then when we ran into the camp just now who was thar but Hemsley the county sheriff whose deputies have been after me for a week </s>
<s> Maybe the Big Chief's savin' me to l'arn me something more </s>
<s> So again I says `Praise God!' Will you travel with me camarada </s>
<s> he went on </s>
<s> The whole big world's waitin' for us </s>
<s> I kin read an' write an' my arms are strong </s>
<s> We'll ride the plains an' climb the hills an' swim in the rivers and when you're tired I'll carry you on my shoulder </s>
<s> Then we'll take in the big flat cities Little Peachey an' walk around 'em at night lookin' on friendly </s>
<s> Yes we'll drop in at all of 'em stringin' out across the country like sideshows on the old Chicago Midway </s>
<s> And one o' these days when we're gittin' real old we'll pull up stakes an' start off to locate our last campin' ground </s>
<s> Thar ain't no maps nor surveys to it it's just somewhar over yonder and we'll know it on sight Little Peachey </s>
<s> Maybe it's some picayune island chucked into the middle o' the ocean with one high rock whar we can sit and watch the sun arisin' an' the sun asettin' an' the seagulls flyin' </s>
<s> And we'll talk over old times Little Peachey an' we'll just sit an' watch an' wait thar together tilltill thar ain't nothin' left at all only the rocks an' the sky an' the gulls ascreamin' at the sea </s>
<s> Peachey a man read me some pieces out o' a book once and I wrote 'em down an' learned 'em </s>
<s> `For springtime is here' it says `thou soul unloosenedthe restlessness after I know not what </s>
<s> Oh if we could but fly like a bird </s>
<s> Oh to escape to sail forth as on a ship!' Camarada give me your hand </s>
<s> I will give you myself more precious than money </s>
<s> Will you give me yourself </s>
<s> Will you travel with me </s>
<s> Shall we stick by each other as long as we live </s>
<s> The chant of his voice died away upon the night and there was no sound but the soft ripple of the water under keel </s>
<s> In the bow sat the girl motionless as a crouched Indian her face fixed upon the nearing shore </s>
<s> As the water shoaled the Man stroked powerfully landing the canoe sternforemost then he stepped forth drew it along the bank and said Camarada give me your hand </s>
<s> But already the girl had risen steadying herself with the bow paddle </s>
<s> With a sinuous movement she eluded his arms and fled then voices woke amid the pines and the Man strode forward to find his way blocked by two men holding the sobbing girl between them </s>
<s> I've seen enough of this said Hemsley facing him to know what you are </s>
<s> Miss Crane can you find your way home alone </s>
<s> Jim you and I will walk this man over to Rockledge </s>
<s> Peachey </s>
<s> called the Man retreating instantly </s>
<s> Come on over here thar's goin' to be trouble </s>
<s> Git behind me Little Peachey </s>
<s> In the landing place there was driven a heavy stake </s>
<s> He drew this forth then advanced saying earnestly Gentlemen both you size me up wrong </s>
<s> Now I ain't lookin' for trouble but don't you bank too strong on takin' me anywhar with you tonight </s>
<s> Hemsley's right hand drew backward then came the level glitter of a long revolver barrel </s>
<s> Drop that </s>
<s> he began </s>
<s> But suddenly something flashed before his face and the keen edge of a boatpaddle bit numbingly into his extended hand then the girl darted forward to where the revolver lay glistening among the pine needles </s>
<s> Well struck Little Peachey cried the Man and he stepped protectingly in front of her with upraised stake </s>
<s> But she stood from behind him and leveled the revolver full at Hemsley </s>
<s> I don't want your help she said </s>
<s> The words came torn from her in sobbing whispers </s>
<s> Git </s>
<s> Don't you come back no more </s>
<s> Don't you send no one lookin' for this man </s>
<s> I kin take care o' myself I guess </s>
<s> And the look in her eyes warned them to go </s>
<s> Now the Man and the Woman were alone in the black hush of the pine woods </s>
<s> I saved you she said at length now go away from here </s>
<s> Yes go </s>
<s> And as her face lifted defiantly to his her voice slid upward like the lonely untamed wail of some wild creature </s>
<s> Go back from whar you come </s>
<s> Don't you never let me see your face again nor hear you speak don't you never touch me no more you Man </s>
<s> 'Cause I'm scairt o' you I am 'cause you're big an' strong an' you'd forgit a gal like me </s>
<s> 'Cause I hate you an' I hate myself </s>
<s> For an instant the man gazed at her perplexed irresolute then he took her right hand and guided it until the revolver muzzle touched his forehead </s>
<s> Peachey he whispered tenderly you hate mebut could you kill me Little Peachey </s>
<s> And he smiled his great fullhearted smile </s>
<s> Then her hand fell her head sunk upon his breast and a strong shuddering filled all her young body </s>
<s> Oh Man Man </s>

<s> Is Ellen worse today </s>
<s> The opening and closing of the front door brought in a swirl of red and yellow leaves from the porch outside </s>
<s> There came too a breath of sharp sweet October air to tired little Mrs. Kendrick where she paused foot on stair the tray steadied in her hand looking back at her husband </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> It's just that I got Mary Louise Jackson to come over and play with her </s>
<s> I can't ask Aunt Dicey to wait on a negro child like Ma'Lou is and she's got to eat with Ellen so I'm So you're waiting on her yourself supplied Kendrick hanging up a shabby overcoat on the hall rack </s>
<s> I'd do more than that to keep her here his wife returned almost fiercely </s>
<s> I tell you nobody knows till they've tried it what it is to have a child like Ellen always lonesome and pining for company and quarreling with every girl that comes about her </s>
<s> Sometimes I think it would be better if we moved away from Watauga </s>
<s> Everybody pities herthey all notice that she's backward in her studieshow can she help it poor dear with that hip joint the way it is </s>
<s> Kendrick came closer he laid a kind arm along the frail bent shoulders of his wife and her senses were aware of the fresh outdoor air as he put his cool cheek to hers </s>
<s> Don't you grieve Fanny he said </s>
<s> Ma'Lou's a good companion for Ellen </s>
<s> The kid's better trained and better educated than half the white girls of her age in Watauga </s>
<s> If things go well in a year or two we'll send Nellie to Baltimore and see what the big man there can do for her </s>
<s> You shall have a daughter that can dance like you used to honey and he patted her shoulder gently </s>
<s> She turned with a little gasping sigh to put up her tired face for his kiss </s>
<s> You're good Scott she murmured then went more cheerfully upstairs and to Ellen's room glancing as she entered at the two girls who were playing happily with paper dolls </s>
<s> Here's your feast she called to them in the gay tone we use with sick children </s>
<s> Come Ellen </s>
<s> I'll go down and give your father his dinner and you two can play any kind of party you want to with this </s>
<s> The little girl with skin like white cotton cloth rolled her big gray eves toward the tray and asked listlessly What you got for dinner ma </s>
<s> The brownskinned one tidily dressed from her carefully combed head with its crisp black mass that was scarcely hair held in place by spickandspan hair ribbons to the toes of her stout handsome shoes got up quickly and came forward to arrange the meal </s>
<s> They's molasses pie Nell Ma'Lou said joyously </s>
<s> Oh I'm going to bring it over there and fix it by the side of the lounge </s>
<s> We'll play you' a sick lady and I'm you' trained nurse </s>
<s> Just wait till I fix my handkerchief into a cap like they wear </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick turned away and left the children at their play </s>
<s> Mary Louise Jackson had been kept at home from school that she might come over and spend the day with Ellen </s>
<s> For when Ellen Kendrick was ill her cry always was Oh send for the doctorand Mary Louise </s>
<s> The old Kendrick place sat back in its grassy yard and concealed behind voluminous chinaberry trees such shabbiness as time had brought it but on the corner the home of Ezra Jackson perched proudly above its stone wall and added a considerable touch of elegance to the street </s>
<s> It was in the early eighties and the Queen Anne style of architecture was just coming into great popularity in the South </s>
<s> Jackson who could well afford it had let an architect have full sway in producing for him a dwelling in the new mode </s>
<s> Ezra Jackson a fullblooded negro born a slave had been a teamster on his master's Georgia plantation and after the war that master who still maintained friendly relations with his exslaves gave him a start in life with a mule and a dray </s>
<s> From this the honest industrious and enterprising man had built up a transfer business which was the best of its sort in town </s>
<s> There were many teams and drivers now and Ezra could walk in the garb of other men of means about him yet he still wrote his name in the manner of the kings of oldhe produced it as a sort of landscape effect without any idea of what the separate characters meant </s>
<s> He was a good citizen a dignified man and except for his black skin he would have been an acceptable neighbor to the Kendricks and a desirable resident in their quarter of town </s>
<s> The young wife whom he had married rather late in life and to whose taste the Queen Anne house catered had a good grammarschool education gained from those first devoted teachers that the Freedman's Bureau sent to the Southern negroes in the years immediately following the war </s>
<s> At first she had kept his books and made out his bills and she always insisted on the best of schooling for their children </s>
<s> Of these latter only Mary Louise concerns this history since she chanced to be very near the age of Ellen Kendrick and had become a necessity in the life of that peevish little invalid </s>
<s> The negro girl had smooth features and her mother saw to it that she was always spotlessly dressed and that her manners were perfect </s>
<s> The children of her race take to good manners very readily being usually amiable and eager for approbation </s>
<s> Mrs. Jackson undoubtedly took pride in the connection with her aristocratic white neighbors and Mrs. Kendrick was forced to be glad of the chance to have the Jackson child come over and play with Ellen </s>
<s> A nurse she could have hired but a child near the afflicted girl's age a soundnatured sweettempered wellbred little girl was not to be had for moneylove was the only coin current that could pay for that </s>
<s> And the two girls loved each otherof course they did </s>
<s> Did not Ellen need Ma'Lou and is not service the basis of all love </s>
<s> The flame on the altar of their affection burned always clear and strong unshaken by the peevish gusts that extinguished many a less sturdy light of friendship for the Kendrick girl </s>
<s> So that existence to Ellenthe pleasant part of it anyhowmeant a great deal of Ma'Lou and there was scarcely an object in her room a game or a pursuit of her days that was not associated with the brown girl </s>
<s> The pair grew up in a companionship closer than that of some born sisters </s>
<s> The mere fact of this intimacy was not regarded by the Kendricks with any disfavor whatever </s>
<s> Scott and Fanny both had played with negro children both had been reared by negro mammies </s>
<s> Neither realized that conditions were changed that the negroes with whom they had associated were no longer an enslaved people hopeless of any equality nor that with the coming of freedom and still more with the growing ferment among the blacks such association was different from the intimacy of slavery days </s>
<s> And Ezra Jackson's wife watched jealously that the preponderance of gifts and favors should be always on her child's side </s>
<s> If any present were given Mary Louise in the Kendrick house her mother always retorted instantly as one might say with something better or handsomer </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick was a slow woman and such a point would naturally have been obscure to her yet she finally came to be aware of the fact and at last it vexed her a little </s>
<s> She turned the question in her mind and sought for some substantial favor or patronage which she might offer to the Jacksons to quiet once for all her offended sense of fitness </s>
<s> It fell out that about this time she was passing their home on her way to her own loaded down with bundles from the market because her cook Aunt Dicey was old and feeble and there had been nobody else to go this morning when she raised her eyes and saw the Jackson back yard full of snowy wash on the line </s>
<s> Mrs. Jackson stood in the kitchen door and at the juxtaposition of the dark skin and the wellwashed clothes an idea promptly occurred to the lawyer's wife </s>
<s> Good morning she called in a friendly tone </s>
<s> I wanted to ask you something I guess I'll come through the gate and go out your front way if you don't mind </s>
<s> Ezra Jackson's wife ran down the steps and put out a hand to help the tired woman with her packages </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick rested them on the railing of the back porch </s>
<s> Your clothes look lovely she said meditatively </s>
<s> You get them out so early </s>
<s> Aunt Dicey's too old to do the washing and cooking both any longer </s>
<s> I've been thinking for some time that I would really have to get me a washerwoman </s>
<s> It is hard to have the person who cooks wash also said Mrs. Jackson choosing her words carefully and speaking in that serious tone which the new generation of colored people are apt to use toward their white neighbors </s>
<s> It is always as though they were on guard or perhaps on parade is the better word determined not to be guilty of lapses which would be excusable in those whom they address but which are not permitted to the inferior race </s>
<s> Fanny Kendrick looked at the handsome wellkept house and its dignified seriousfaced mistress and a feeling of irritation rose within her </s>
<s> I thought maybe youI want a washerwomanand seeing your clothes looked so nice made me think that maybe you She came to an uncertain halt and glanced again half impatiently at the other woman </s>
<s> After all Ezra Jackson's wife was just a negro and there was no use in feeling embarrassed or in supposing you didn't know how to deal with negroes </s>
<s> Good gracious </s>
<s> what was the world coming to if you couldn't offer work to folks without blushing </s>
<s> But she did not complete her sentence </s>
<s> The Jackson woman waited for a while that she might do so and finally said still in that slow correct utterance which was in itself an offense You thought I might tell you of some one </s>
<s> Mrs. Payson does mine </s>
<s> As you say she does it very nicely and is quick about it </s>
<s> Her prices are high </s>
<s> I pay her half a dollar and she gets done as you see a good deal before noon </s>
<s> But the work is satisfactory and I think it pays better </s>
<s> I don't know whether she has a free daybutshall I send her to you when she comes next week </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick blushed burning red and took up her bundles with a jerk </s>
<s> No thank you she said shortly </s>
<s> I couldn't any more afford that than I could fly </s>
<s> I didn't know Sally Payson had got to charging like thatfifty cents for less than half a day's work </s>
<s> I declare prices are enough to ruin a body these days </s>
<s> She went on to her own home smarting </s>
<s> She had called the washer woman Sally Payson to be sure in correction of Eliza Jackson's Mrs. Payson which was a minor victory yet it was not enough to wipe away a feeling of stinging exasperation and a curious sense of defeat </s>
<s> And when she told her husband about it afterward he received her recital with a sort of humorous impatience </s>
<s> Good Lord Fan he broke in finally don't you know that every woman with a black skin isn't hungry to do your washing </s>
<s> It's not a question of complexion it's money that talks </s>
<s> Ezra Jackson could buy me out two or three times over </s>
<s> I'm trying to act all his legal business </s>
<s> He's bringing a big suit against the railroad </s>
<s> If he gives it to me I shall be able to send Ellen to Baltimore this year instead of next </s>
<s> Well said Mrs. Kendrick submissively but acidly if you want me to go and apologize I suppose I can </s>
<s> The South is getting to be a queer place when white gentlemen have to be under obligation to negro teamsters </s>
<s> I certainly don't want to interfere with your business in any way Scott she concluded plaintively </s>
<s> We're hard up all the time I feel it deeply that poor Ellen is such an expense to you </s>
<s> Scott Kendrick's ready arm went round the weary little woman </s>
<s> An apology would be worse than the offense Fanny he admonished gently </s>
<s> It's just this </s>
<s> the Jacksons are in an absolutely new position and have to be treated in a new way </s>
<s> You wouldn't go and ask Mrs. Ford or Mrs. Brashear to do your washing and the Lord knows that neither Jim Brashear nor Bate Ford makes half what Ezra Jackson does </s>
<s> The world is changing honey and we have to change with it </s>
<s> II As they grew older the association of the two girls in spite of the affection between themperhaps because of itbegan to present almost daily problems and embarrassments </s>
<s> Ellen's health was worse her nerves were shattered and she clung with more and more insistence to this one healthy companion who responded with a tireless devotion </s>
<s> Coming in from her wholesome outdoor life and her triumphs at schoolwhere she always stood highMa'Lou brought to the sick room a very wind of comfort and cheer which Mrs. Kendrick had not the heart to deny her pining young invalid </s>
<s> Once when she spoke apprehensively of the matter to her husband Scott Kendrick answered with astonishment Why Fanny it's only a question of healtha little bodily improvement </s>
<s> We'd break it off tomorrow if Ellen was well </s>
<s> You'll see there would never be any more of it if I could send her away for that operation </s>
<s> But the white people had not as they supposed this anxiety all to themselves </s>
<s> The timid conservative colored mother regarded the friendship with growing anxiety </s>
<s> And before Scott Kendrick got together the money to send Ellen to Baltimore Ezra Jackson's wife had coaxed her husband into letting Mary Louise go North to school </s>
<s> The Watauga public schools with a term or two of Fiske at Nashville afterward had been good enough for the other children </s>
<s> But the mother craved wider opportunities for this her youngest money was freer with them now and Mary Louise went to a preparatory school then to Oberlin </s>
<s> Ellen Kendrick returned from the hands of the surgeons in Baltimore much improved in health </s>
<s> She was sent back twice afterward for treatment </s>
<s> Finally she walked as well as other girls and hastily made up her arrears of education as best she might at a private school in Watauga </s>
<s> She would always be frail the invalid habit had gotten into both mind and body she would continue dependent demanding and somewhat irritable yet there was a fragile prettiness about her and her very childishness had its own charm </s>
<s> Mary Louise Jackson passed one of two vacations at home but as time went on there were opportunities for her to have trips of an educational nature and one summer was spent at a Chautauqua taking a special course so that after the first break in their association the two girls saw almost nothing of each other till they were women grown </s>
<s> There had been some letters yet what the white girl had always demanded and received from her friend could not come through the mails and the neglected correspondence finally died a natural death </s>
<s> There was one person in Watauga however to whom Mary Louise wrote and from whom she received letters regularlyUlysses Grant Payson the washerwoman's son with whom she had gone to school </s>
<s> Grant Payson was a sober ambitious industrious fellow who seemed to feel from childhood the weight of responsibility for his people </s>
<s> A widow's only boy he had worked hard and studied hard </s>
<s> With a very fair mental endowment he was able to get what the Watauga public schools could give him secure a few years training at Nashville then read law </s>
<s> And when after her graduation Mary Louise returned to her father's home a very welleducated young lady indeed wearing glasses and looking older than her years she found Grant established in a good practice and with some other prospects that were for a colored man flattering </s>
<s> Both families knew that Grant wanted Ma'Lou </s>
<s> Whether the girl would marry him and settle down in Watauga had been a matter of anxiety often talked over between the two mothers </s>
<s> For they also knew of and discussed Ma'Lou's opportunity to take a position as private secretary to one of the instructors in her college </s>
<s> They understood that it was a situation which would pay fairly well and give her associates who gained an added glory in the minds of these humble folk by their distance </s>
<s> In short it would be a foothold in the white people's world and Grant Payson's mother trembled for her son while the mother of Mary Jackson feared to lose once for all her daughter </s>
<s> The two Southernbred black women could see in such things as the girl reported only the wiping out of all race barrier the sudden achievement of equality </s>
<s> Had Mary Louise been asked no doubt she could have told them of a social ban at the North quite as definite as that in Watauga if different but her father's daughter kept a silence that was not without dignity over what she found irremediable in the North as in the South </s>
<s> To warmhearted Mary Louise Watauga meant of course father and mother but directly after themperhaps before them in the calendar of youthit meant Ellen Kendrick and Grant Payson </s>
<s> And the colored elders looking on felt that as these twin idols of the girl turned out so rose or fell the chances of keeping her with them in Watauga </s>
<s> Grant instituted at once a courtship as ardent and eager as it was open and avowed </s>
<s> His people florid and colorful in temperament are natural wooers free of the language of affection and adroit in its use </s>
<s> Grant was very much in love with the girl and she meant even more to him than that since in aspiring to her his ambition stepped hand in hand with his affections </s>
<s> Mary Louise received his advances with curious reservations as though there were positions and premises she defended against him </s>
<s> It was when the girl's visit was three weeks old that the finelooking broadshouldered young colored man in his wellfitting business suita goodly figure in the eyes of the mother watching from her own room across the hallleft the parlor where he and Mary Louise had been sitting all evening with so doleful a countenance that the older woman had a quickly suppressed impulse to go to him and speak </s>
<s> She did open the subject to the girl next morning approaching it obliquely </s>
<s> In her own day a very progressive person she felt that her daughter had far outstripped her and she offered advice but timidly to this tall perfectly dressed young woman who seemed so competent in all the affairs of life and who knew so much more than she did upon many subjects </s>
<s> But after a little profitless skirmishing she came out with Looks like you must have said something hard to Grant last nighthe never came in to say goodby to me </s>
<s> Ain't you going to have him Ma'Lou </s>
<s> Don't you care anything about him </s>
<s> I care a great deal about Grant Mary Louise told her in a voice of pain </s>
<s> I could love him dearlyif I'd let myself </s>
<s> But mother I just can't settle down to live here in Watauga </s>
<s> There's nobody and nothing here for me </s>
<s> The woman looked at her child and her mind misgave her sorely that she had done wrong to send the girl away among an alien people where she would learn to despise her own </s>
<s> You're still grievin' about Ellen Kendrick she said finally </s>
<s> If I were you I wouldn't let that go the way it has </s>
<s> Don't she hesitated with eyes full of helpless solicitude upon her daughter's facehoney don't wait for any sign from Ellen because you won't get it </s>
<s> You just take those postal cards that you got for her on your Canadian trip and some morning you step over to the side door and ask for her if you want to see her </s>
<s> I know she thinks a great deal of you </s>
<s> She's stopped me on the street more than once and asked all about you and what you were doing </s>
<s> I don't see why you shouldn't go to the side door and go in and have a nice little visit with her </s>
<s> Mary Louise considered this suggestion at some length </s>
<s> She had the wider outlook which some travel gives and in Oberlin she had been where the race question was relatively negligible </s>
<s> Her mother's way of putting it jarred on her yet the hungry craving she felt at this time for a touch of companionship with a girl of her own age her longing for the beloved Ellen of her childhood overbore all shrinking </s>
<s> That afternoon she brought the cards down in her hand and full of an unwelcome timidity made her way to the side door of the Kendrick house and rapped </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick answered and received her with a certain thin cordiality that suggested reservations </s>
<s> The fact was that Ellen was having a little party that evening and the colored girl would perhaps be in the way </s>
<s> Among the guests bidden were two young men upon either one of whom Mrs. Kendrick looked with a hopeful maternal eye and nothing could be less desirable than for her daughter to seem to even herself with negroes in the eyes of these possible suitors </s>
<s> Shall I stop and see Ellen a minute or may I just leave these with you Mrs. Kendrick </s>
<s> asked the tall brownskinned young woman finally </s>
<s> Oh come income right in here to the dining room and sit down said the mistress of the house remembering with a twinge how much she owed to this girl </s>
<s> Ellen will be crazy about these </s>
<s> She's got a postal card album and she hasn't anything in it from Canada </s>
<s> Ellen </s>
<s> Come downstairs honey Ma'Lou Jackson has brought you something pretty </s>
<s> But even as she called up the stairway and heard the quick response from above it crossed Mrs. Kendrick's mind that her daughter would not be willing to put these postal cards in her album for she would be ashamed to tell from whom they came </s>
<s> She was annoyed when Ellen came flying down the stairs her thin blond hair all about her shoulders and caught both the newcomer's handsthe mother feared for a moment that she would kiss her old playmate </s>
<s> And then if somebody saw it through the window and went and told young Emery Ford or Mr. Hyatt I don't know what on earth I should do reflected the careworn matron </s>
<s> Mamma do come and look at these lovely postals Ellen cried effusively a little later as her mother plainly ill at ease passed through the room </s>
<s> I'm going to pull out those that Cousin Rob sent me from Texas and put these in right after the California ones </s>
<s> See here mamma isn't this one beautiful </s>
<s> Ma'Lou was there a week </s>
<s> She's put a little cross over the hotel where they stayed </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick looked at the strong welldeveloped figure of her guest and a certain dull anger arose in her mind </s>
<s> Why did health and money both go to this inferior creature when they were lacking in higher quarters </s>
<s> Perhaps this prompted her query That hotel </s>
<s> It's a big one isn't it </s>
<s> Did theycould you </s>
<s> She broke off and Mary Louise supplied innocently enough Oh they didn't let us travel during school term </s>
<s> This was a vacation trip </s>
<s> She had been long away from the South in the protective conditions of Oberlin she had been measurably free from the wounding of race prejudice and now she failed to realize that Mrs. Kendrick's curiosity was as to whether she had been permitted to go to a hotel with white people </s>
<s> Old Dicey's place in the kitchen had long been supplied by a negress of the newer generationthe worst gossip and tattler in town if you might take her mistress's word for it </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick now made her way thither ostensibly to superintend the preparation of the evening's refreshments but in reality to try to fix up an explanation of why Ezra Jackson's daughter sat visiting in the dining room with the young lady of the house </s>
<s> Because if Penny goes out and tells her friends every darky in town'll be retailing the story to the folks that hire them and it'll soon be all over the place </s>
<s> She came back into the dining room to find Ellen glowing with enthusiasm </s>
<s> Yes her mind was still that of a sick child she had dropped back into her oldtime attitude toward Mary Louise </s>
<s> Mamma Ma'Lou says that they used to give lunches at the college and fix the floral centerpiece so it would all come apart and each guest could draw a bunch of it with a ribbon </s>
<s> Oh I don't understand very well but she can tell youit's just beautiful and we could make it out of the chrysanthemums in the side yard she says </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick looked uneasy </s>
<s> But there was no window in the dining room which commanded the street except the side light of the bay and at it Ellen herself sat </s>
<s> Nobody passing would be apt to see Mary Louise over in the room </s>
<s> I reckon we can't go into those things she objected a little irritably </s>
<s> I suppose Ma'Lou has seen a heap of fine doings up North that we couldn't possibly attempt </s>
<s> But she's promised to make me a lot of cute little candieslike potatoes and put them in paper basketsto go at each plate put in Ellen jealously </s>
<s> The brownfaced girl nodded and laughed with a quick flash of white teeth </s>
<s> It was plain she was taking the attitude of an older person talking to a child about a juvenile party to which there could be no question of invitation and Mrs. Kendrick's fears rather subsided </s>
<s> She was safe if only Ellen would show some sense and judgment </s>
<s> Well I must go on home now if I'm to make those candies and have them ready by this evening said Ezra Jackson's daughter getting to her feet </s>
<s> They take a good while to harden properly </s>
<s> Ellen went with her to the side door clinging to her arm and insisting on some last remark </s>
<s> Mrs. Kendrick in an agony of apprehension hovered in the background </s>
<s> Oh well said the daughter of the house finally I won't bother you any more about it now Ma'Lou </s>
<s> It's hard for you to explain just how to fix it but you can show me when you come over this evening </s>
<s> I'll have the chrysanthemums ready </s>
<s> You come a little earlywon't you please </s>
<s> Mary Louise in the doorway glanced from mother to daughter in some confusion </s>
<s> Would this do </s>
<s> Her own mother had cautioned her to be certain to go to the side door </s>
<s> II don't know she hesitated doubtfully </s>
<s> I'll bring the candies over if you like and I might be able to show you a little about the table then </s>
<s> And again she looked from the face of the girl who had been her childhood's most intimate friend and associate to that of the woman who had accepted so much at her childish hands </s>
<s> Why I supposed you'd be here when I was giving the party Ma'Lou argued Ellen petulantly </s>
<s> I don't see why not </s>
<s> Isn't it all right mother </s>
<s> she appealed sharply </s>
<s> Shouldn't Ma'Lou come over this evening </s>
<s> For one desperate moment Mrs. Kendrick sought to shape a policy Ellen's words sounded frightfully like an invitation to the party </s>
<s> Would Mary Louise accept them so </s>
<s> Her worried resentful glance traveled over the tall dignified figure the correct quiet costume </s>
<s> Oh it had no business to be as hard as this </s>
<s> But she must make the girl understand she could not run the risk of injury to Ellen's belated social opportunities </s>
<s> Whyyou seewe she began in an agony of embarrassment we can'twe can't Her voice failed her </s>
<s> She looked fleetingly at Mary Louise who returned the gaze with a look hurt accusing difficult to meet </s>
<s> She drew her breath sharply and began again with more resolution </s>
<s> We'll have an extra maid in to help with the serving </s>
<s> If you don't mind staying in the dining room with her She ceased and waited hopefully to see if the girl understood </s>
<s> There was an uncertain silence </s>
<s> She must finish </s>
<s> Ma'Lou if you'd stay in the dining room with Tillie and wouldn't mind wearing acapand apron like she does why you could come over and look on </s>
<s> Ellen Kendrick had seen somebody coming down the street </s>
<s> It was Emory Ford and she flushed and dimpled and smiled as she bowed to him forgetting everything else including the departing Mary Louise who after one mute look at Mrs. Kendrick's flushed disturbed face turned and walked with hanging head toward the house on the corner </s>
<s> Arrived at home she went methodically to work upon the promised candies and the little baskets that were to contain them </s>
<s> Ezra Jackson's wife noting the face of set misery forbore long to question her as she brought out the novel materials and pursued her work </s>
<s> The afternoon wore on </s>
<s> Mrs. Jackson was at work at her sewingmachine in the front hall but she could not keep out of the kitchen she made continual futile errands through it giving anxious sidelong glances at the child over whom her heart yearned </s>
<s> Finally when she could bear it no more Diddid something hurt your feelings over there Ma'Lou </s>
<s> she asked huskily </s>
<s> She spoke behind her daughter's shoulder </s>
<s> The girl set the last finished basket in its place in the row before she turned to answer </s>
<s> Then she showed a face so much more cheerful and composed than the elder woman had dared hope for that the relief was almost revulsion </s>
<s> Sit down mother said Mary Lou pushing a chair with her foot </s>
<s> Sit there while I fill the baskets and I'll tell you about it </s>
<s> The mother sat and watched the deft brown fingers and marveled at the girl's collected manner her quiet even voice </s>
<s> For Ezra Jackson's wife was shaken by alternate gusts of anger and hurt pride of shame and fear as with a judicial fairness extraordinary in one of her years and sex the girl went over the details of that unhappy visit </s>
<s> The old teamster had given his child a heritage of rare good sense </s>
<s> Early in the recital the woman broke in bitterly with And yet you're making candies for her party </s>
<s> Such as that is all they want of you </s>
<s> I wouldn't do it </s>
<s> And I'd never step foot in their house again </s>
<s> Why mother I'd certainly make these </s>
<s> I promised them said Mary Louise mildly </s>
<s> She put the last tiny candy potato in place pushed back the basket wiped her hands and turned fully to her mother </s>
<s> But you're exactly right about not entering Judge Kendrick's house again she said with increasing emphasis </s>
<s> I can't go in at the front door as a friendthat's true I can't </s>
<s> I certainly sha'n't go in at the back door as a servantandI've thought it all out nowI see it plainour people make a great mistake when they hang around the side doors of white folks </s>
<s> There's no way but Don't say it honey </s>
<s> gasped the mother Wait a minute </s>
<s> This was the end and she could not quite face it </s>
<s> She was to lose her youngest and dearest </s>
<s> Mary Lou was going back North to live among the white people </s>
<s> Her head went down on the table the convulsed face hidden in her arms </s>
<s> Then broke forth the cry of the blood Oh Lord </s>
<s> I reckon I'm just another fool nigger woman that's raised a child too good for her own color </s>
<s> I wish I was deadI wish I was dead </s>
<s> Mothermother </s>
<s> The girl flung herself on her knees beside the chair and caught at the other's dress </s>
<s> Don't take on that way </s>
<s> You don't understand </s>
<s> I'mlook around hereI'm glad of what happened over there today </s>
<s> It's shown me the truth about a good many things </s>
<s> We're all black people together </s>
<s> It's the only way for us now </s>
<s> I'm not going back to be Professor Sheridan's secretarya black woman among white people </s>
<s> I'm going to marry Granthe's everything to me these people are nothingand settle right down here in Watauga with himand be happy and useful </s>

<s> etc </s>
<s> Like so many others of her class Stella Willoughby was a satisfied confident woman placidly aware of the station her husband's money assured to her </s>
<s> For Willoughby was accounted wealthy even in this lake town where riches were so much in evidence and if the wife betrayed a cool superiority because of his money it was only natural perhaps since she and most of her associates knew no other means of gauging success or worth or the individual's place in life </s>
<s> Looking over her shoulder now she glanced nonchalantly across the club diningroom </s>
<s> You mean those peoplethe Severances Mrs. Kinsman </s>
<s> There was a bland indifference in her tone that made the guest beside Mrs. Willoughby look at her curiously for she knew that Severance had once been a suitor for Mrs. Willoughby's hand </s>
<s> I believe we did know them before they dropped out </s>
<s> He lost everything didn't he?went to smash as I vaguely remember </s>
<s> Still with the same air of unconcern she dipped the tips of her fingers in the fingerbowl and prepared to rise </s>
<s> Queer they should come back here isn't it </s>
<s> she commented idly and then as if the subject had passed from her mind with the observation Mrs. Willoughby pushed back her chair in signal to her guests and led the way from the room </s>
<s> In the hall while the maid was putting on her wraps she turned and looked back still idly as before </s>
<s> Her eyes traveling about rested a moment on the man sitting at the distant table and then when he half rose from his place as if to bow they journeyed on again coolly unconcerned </s>
<s> A moment later smiling gayly she walked down the steps to her carriage and with her guests was driven away to the theatre </s>
<s> Yet somehow in spite of this sureness of speech and manner the sight of her oldtime suitor had wakened in Mrs. Willoughby the subtle discontent that occasionally affected herthe discontent of women who have only themselves to think about </s>
<s> One might have said that at these times she was subconsciously wearied of her form of life that in so many words though ignorant of the fact though consciously her vacuous life immensely satisfied her she was BORED </s>
<s> But today bluntly speaking it was about her husband that her vague dissatisfaction centered and when she had glanced coolly at her former suitor it was for the purpose of comparison </s>
<s> Willoughby was a fair type of the moneygetter </s>
<s> Furthermore what he had built had been raised by his own hands unaided he was a selfmade man whose one boast was that he owed nothing to any one not even so little as a debt of gratitude </s>
<s> One realized the fact too in the way he carried on his affairs for in his business he was alert and determined implacably pursuing his moneymaking as if it were a warfare and considerate of none but those joined with him in the moment's harvesting venture </s>
<s> Perhaps his reasons were sufficientwho knows </s>
<s> Perhaps Willoughby was as well aware as they that the friends of today might reasonably become the enemies of tomorrow </s>
<s> But at home the money gathered so ruthlessly elsewhere was thrown about with a lavish hand </s>
<s> Nothing that wealth could provide was denied Mrs. Willoughby or her boy and though she had been poor when she married money in the mere crudity of having it to spend had long since lost its novelty </s>
<s> Today beyond the pride of having it and beyond the luxury and ostentation it could buy money possessed for her a far greater significance in its power to make one powerful </s>
<s> In that she had already tasted the illogical enjoyment of one that can obtain power in no other way </s>
<s> And it was because of this place that his money had bought her that Mrs. Willoughby began to look on her husband with a critical eye </s>
<s> For she was an ambitious woman though one with definite limitations </s>
<s> Among different surroundings and in an atmosphere less sordidly striving and commonplace she was fitted to have become with some encouragement an admirable and utterly inconspicuous wife and mother </s>
<s> But here in this narrow moneygetting environment many things prevented among them primarily the way in which she had been brought up </s>
<s> For her father too had been driven by this lust for riches and though he had failed to the last he had been goaded on by his one eager grasping hope </s>
<s> He had drummed into her head the single lesson that without money one is nothing </s>
<s> In itself it suggested to the few a plausible reason why she had married Willoughby </s>
<s> There had been nothing openly unhappy in their life together </s>
<s> Still as others saw Willoughby was much older than his wife radically without her social instincts and furthermore when she had accepted him it had been pretty generally understood that Severance had won her heart </s>
<s> And now as she sat back in her carriage remembrance came rapping like an unwelcome unadmitted visitant </s>
<s> She tried to put it away by chattering smartly the theatrewagon rolled along to the clicking of hoofs on the asphalt but through it all the troublous knocking persistently recurred </s>
<s> For this was one of the few times when she had lingered upon a thought of that first romance of hers and now coupled with her hardening criticism of Willoughby it brought forth insistent questions </s>
<s> Whether she had really loved her husband when she married him or whether she had not instead been dazzled by his peculiar abilities remained in doubt </s>
<s> Severance had come first he had a little money to begin and he was doing well with it and seemed on the road to do better </s>
<s> Therefore her friends were secure in the belief that she would marry him when Willoughby had made his appearance </s>
<s> He went at this lovemaking of his as he went at all his affairsimplacably bold and ruthlessly sweeping aside whoever or whatever came into his way </s>
<s> The fact that he and Severance were considered friends seemed to have counted little and when a few months later it was learned that she had dropped one to take the other it was also learned that Severance had played at ducks and drakes with his money </s>
<s> Briefly he had become bankrupt in a mining deal </s>
<s> He and others Willoughby among them had gone into a Wyoming copper prospectthe Teton Sisters Companyand while Willoughby apparently got off without damage Severance had dropped everything </s>
<s> How was never clearly understood </s>
<s> Severance and his sister had parted with their home to satisfy his creditors and then moved away </s>
<s> In the twelve years of the Willoughbys' married life the tide of money had kept steadfastly on the flood </s>
<s> Nothing his hands touched seemed to fail him </s>
<s> He had his fingers in every kind of venturemines and mills foundries and furnaces steam roads trolley lines and public utilities and to each and every one of these promotions the name of Willoughby affixed the hallmark of success </s>
<s> Now his dollars jingled in every state of the Unionand they jingled in his own home too almost as the only evidences that the home was his </s>
<s> For Willoughby pursuing money everywhere seemed to have lost interest in all else but his moneygrubbing just as Willoughby's wife excepting for the same moneygrubbing seemed to have lost all interest in him </s>
<s> And now she had looked at Severance her eyes had rested on him long enough to make comparisonsSeverance much improved cool suave presentable and deferential her husband big and masterful a brooding preoccupied man and a kind of Orson to be kept denned in his money caves </s>
<s> She sighed to herself regretfully </s>
<s> Some minutes after Mrs. Willoughby had found her seat in the theatre box she was aware of another party coming down the aisle </s>
<s> Hello </s>
<s> exclaimed the man beside her here come Hudson Mills and his wife with Case Severance </s>
<s> I didn't know he was in town </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby laid a gloved finger to her lips and affected to yawn though she stole a glance out of the corner of her eye </s>
<s> Her guest was now nodding over her shoulder at the arrivals in the seats below </s>
<s> Severance has made a tenstrike I hear he volunteered in an expressive if inelegant idiom of the money game there's a story going the rounds that Mills and Severance have been gunning together and that some one else got burned </s>
<s> Anyway I hear they've lined their pockets </s>
<s> Severance is rich again </s>
<s> This mixed metaphor affected Mrs. Willoughby with a curious interest </s>
<s> Oh is he </s>
<s> she exclaimed and glancing down she looked unexpectedly into Severance's watching eyes </s>
<s> But she seemed not in the least disconcerted </s>
<s> Severance was just turning away mindful of the previous snub when with a reassuring smile she bowed and then smiled again </s>
<s> For why not </s>
<s> Severance's position had been reestablished in her world </s>
<s> It was late that night when Mrs. Willoughby returned home </s>
<s> There was a light in her husband's library and before going to her room she stopped and tapped at the door </s>
<s> Willoughby with a pile of papers stacked before him sat with his chin in his hand staring absently at the wall </s>
<s> As the door opened he turned for a moment and then seeing who it was thrust his hands into his pockets and slouched down in his chair </s>
<s> Well </s>
<s> he murmured absently </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby slipping out of her wrap dropped into a convenient seat </s>
<s> Are you still at it </s>
<s> It's nearly one o'clock Harmon </s>
<s> Yawning slightly she wriggled her feet out of her carriage slippers and kicked them under her chair </s>
<s> Willoughby looked up silently watching her and a momentary small shadow crept into his face </s>
<s> Yet the shadow small as it was could not have been because of any flaw in his wife's appearance </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby was still young and fair to look upon cleareyed and almost girlish her rounded regular features set off picturesquely by her hat and its flowing purple plumes even though both hat and plumes were extravagant in size </s>
<s> Willoughby must have known another reason to frown </s>
<s> Where've you been </s>
<s> he demanded heavily his voice bare of any interest </s>
<s> He was a large florid man heavily built squarejawed and with the deep scrutinous eyes of one aware of his own power and accustomed to enforce it </s>
<s> But now his eyes seemed listless as if weary of the strain that had kept them so long on the alert </s>
<s> I </s>
<s> At the club she answered briefly </s>
<s> Though her own home was large and amply appointed few were ever asked there to anything more formal than a luncheon or an afternoon at bridge </s>
<s> Home hospitality and the housekeeping it involved had long since become a bore to her like many others in her set she had learned to square her obligations through the convenience of her husband's club </s>
<s> The hospitality there entailed no other bother than paying the bills </s>
<s> Just dinner at the club and the theatre afterward </s>
<s> She stripped off her long gloves and dropped them to the floor beside her carriage slippers </s>
<s> Again her husband studied her almost covertly one might have thought </s>
<s> Any one there </s>
<s> Willoughby began absently to pick at the edges of the papers on his desk </s>
<s> She shook her head </s>
<s> No one you'd care about I think </s>
<s> There were only three tables besides mine </s>
<s> Mrs. Chardon and her daughter with some of her young friends and then Mrs. Willoughby closely inspected one of her rubies </s>
<s> The Severances are back in town Harmon </s>
<s> He and his sister were there with Hudson Mills and his wife </s>
<s> Severancewith MILLS </s>
<s> cried her husband lifting his head alertly </s>
<s> It was not often that Mrs. Willoughby's talk with him evoked such instant attention </s>
<s> See here Stella are you sure it was Severance </s>
<s> Sure </s>
<s> Sure whether it was Severance </s>
<s> Why of course I am </s>
<s> she answered petulantly </s>
<s> She and her husband had never discussed the man and it seemed a late day now to begin </s>
<s> What in the world is </s>
<s> she began and then desisted </s>
<s> Willoughby slouched down in his chair again had dropped his chin on his breast and was nervously gnawing his lip </s>
<s> His wife leaned over and gathered up slippers and gloves </s>
<s> I think I'll go to bed she murmured carelessly and wandered toward the door </s>
<s> Willoughby made no response and she turned and slowly came back </s>
<s> A calendar hanging from the gas bracket had fallen a little aslant and she reached up and critically straightened it </s>
<s> Harmon I hear Case Severance is rich again </s>
<s> I wonder how he managed it </s>
<s> Hey </s>
<s> Who </s>
<s> Willoughby jerked up his head as if startled from a dreamand not a very pretty dream either if one might judge from his countenance </s>
<s> Oh you mean HIM he uttered thickly </s>
<s> How do I know </s>
<s> I suppose he's been up to some of his games again </s>
<s> An almost savage dislike and contempt evidenced themselves in his tone and pushing back his chair he picked up his papers and arose </s>
<s> You'd better go to bed Stella he suggested brusquely averting his eyes from her quick scrutiny I've got a lot of work here </s>
<s> She laid a hand on his arm </s>
<s> What's wrong with you </s>
<s> she asked intently </s>
<s> There was alertness in the question rather than responsive softness </s>
<s> Willoughby drew a hand across his mouth </s>
<s> Nothing's wrong Stella </s>
<s> I've had a hard day </s>
<s> Aren't you going </s>
<s> Yesin just a moment </s>
<s> She had moved toward the door again and now was standing with her hand on the knob </s>
<s> It's Willard's birthday next Wednesday </s>
<s> Willard was their boy </s>
<s> He'll be eleven an he wants an electric runabout </s>
<s> The Doane boys have one and he's just crazy about it We'd better let him have it </s>
<s> Willoughby frowned and irritably ruffled the papers in his hand </s>
<s> A runabout </s>
<s> No he sha'n't have it </s>
<s> He's too young and besides Oh nonsense Harmon </s>
<s> Willoughby fluttered his papers more irritably than before </s>
<s> Well he can't have it that's all I have to say </s>
<s> Ordinarily he gave to her and the boy what they wished never questioning the cost or character of what they bought Eleven and wants an automobile </s>
<s> he commented sullenly </s>
<s> When I was his age I was working day and night to support my Yes I know Harmon interrupted Mrs. Willoughby affecting to stifle a yawn but Willard fortunately doesn't have to think of that </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby gave her gloves a disdainful careless twirl and went on her way to her room </s>
<s> To her astonishment a few moments later she heard the front door slam </s>
<s> Willoughby had gone out </s>
<s> He was away for nearly a week and when he returned his eyes were heavy and bloodshot his face was pallid and wearily drawn </s>
<s> Well so you are back </s>
<s> What have you been doing </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby asked perfunctorily </s>
<s> Though it was late in the morning she was still in bed sitting up in a dressing sack and turning the pages of a weekly publication that dealt in news of local high life </s>
<s> Its chief item today was the announcement of a dance she was to give shortlyat the club as usualand she had just finished for the second time the commentator's glib and unctuous phrasing </s>
<s> He answered evasively Oh just away on business </s>
<s> As he walked to the window and looked out she carelessly turned the pages </s>
<s> Stella what did you do for the boy's birthday </s>
<s> he asked slowly pacing back to the foot of the bed </s>
<s> She turned another page </s>
<s> The boy </s>
<s> Oh I gave him some money and sent him downtown with the coachman </s>
<s> I was too busy </s>
<s> Smiling lightly she went on glancing through the paper </s>
<s> I suspect he stuffed himself on candy </s>
<s> But there was no answering smile on Willoughby's face </s>
<s> On candy </s>
<s> How much did you give him </s>
<s> Without looking up she answered as lightly as before </s>
<s> Oh I can't remember now </s>
<s> Let me think </s>
<s> Then she vaguely named an amount and Willoughby pressed his lips together </s>
<s> Stella he said slowly after a moment's darkening of his eyes do you know that amounts to a week's salary of more than one of my clerks </s>
<s> Don't you think it was a great deal to give a boy </s>
<s> She looked up now astonisheda little vexed too for this was the second time he had questioned her use of money </s>
<s> Well what of it </s>
<s> It seems of little consequence </s>
<s> She buried her face in the paper again after this shot and Willoughby stared at her </s>
<s> No he murmured reflectively an alarming bitterness in his voice nothing seems of any consequence </s>
<s> As she glanced casually over the top of her paper she saw him draw a hand across his face but still vexed she took no warning from the sign </s>
<s> Well there's no need of making a fuss is there </s>
<s> she asked rebukingly </s>
<s> Thus showing how distasteful the subject had become and having had her say she instantly changed the topic </s>
<s> You're coming home Thursday night aren't you </s>
<s> Willoughby watched her absorbedly </s>
<s> I don't know </s>
<s> Why </s>
<s> Oh I just wanted to find out </s>
<s> It's the night of my dance you know </s>
<s> A dance </s>
<s> Your dance </s>
<s> He drew in his breath and his hands gripping the bed's footboard closed a little tighter </s>
<s> I'd forgotten that </s>
<s> Yes your dance and I He broke off wearily his lips framing a mere wraith of a smile and in its gravity she still saw no warning of deep waters stirring troublously </s>
<s> A danceyou're giving a dance </s>
<s> he repeated and there came into his eyes a subtle hint of mockery that coupled with the words gave them almost the significance of a jeer </s>
<s> Oh for heaven's sake Harmon </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby threw down her paper irritably aware only of the unspoken protest in his manner and disdaining to analyze it </s>
<s> See hereare you going to make a fuss about that too </s>
<s> Or are you still growling about the boy </s>
<s> I should think a man with your money would be above It seemed unnecessary to round out the sentence in itself the fragment sharply uttered peevish and fretful conveyed more than enough </s>
<s> You wouldn't let him have what he wanted so what's the use of making it any worse </s>
<s> He swallowed his disappointment but if you're getting ready to complain about me now I'll Yes I've thought there was good stuff in the boy he interrupted the slow words cutting short her vehement protest </s>
<s> Where is he now </s>
<s> he added abruptly </s>
<s> I think I'd like to see him </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby flounced down among the pillows </s>
<s> I don't knowat school I suppose </s>
<s> Aren't you going to your office today </s>
<s> Willoughby shook his head </s>
<s> He turned to the door moving heavily and there at last in his sunken head his shoulders wearily bent she caught some hint of the man's hidden emotion </s>
<s> Astonishment at first ousted all else from her thought and she gaped at him in wonder </s>
<s> Then came a small chilling touch of fear </s>
<s> HARMON </s>
<s> At the swift call he looked back at her </s>
<s> Harmon </s>
<s> Has anything happened </s>
<s> His answer was an evasion and she knew it </s>
<s> I'm staying home to see some men </s>
<s> That's all </s>
<s> But the moment's fear was too stressful to be so easily set at rest </s>
<s> Waitdo you hear </s>
<s> She slipped from the bed and with her eyes still fastened on him she groped about till she found her down slippers </s>
<s> Willoughby had slowly opened the door but his wife angrily reached over his shoulder and pushed it shut </s>
<s> You SHALL tell me </s>
<s> she insisted fiercely determined </s>
<s> I want to know what's happened </s>
<s> Willoughby shook off her hand and renewed his effort at the door </s>
<s> I've nothing to tell you he rumbled sullenly and thenWhat do you want to know for </s>
<s> She caught her breath certain now of the fear that shook her like an ague </s>
<s> He was in trouble and trouble to her meant but the one thinga money trouble </s>
<s> It was the first time in her years of placid selfpossessed vanity that any terror like this had come to jar her </s>
<s> To lose it nowthis bought and paidfor complacency this counterpart of happiness struck her to the heart with a keener more convincingly human emotion than she had known for many a day in her negligent shallow existence </s>
<s> You want to know </s>
<s> he answered and smiled at her in grim accusing mockery </s>
<s> All right then I'll tell you </s>
<s> You'd better be ready for it too </s>
<s> In his brutality there was a guarded note of selfpity as if to see her suffer would somehow rejoice him in his own trouble </s>
<s> Well I'm smashed upthat's all </s>
<s> I'm ruined </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby shrinking away laid a hand on her lips and stared with distended eyes </s>
<s> RUINED </s>
<s> she gasped unable to believe himincredulously as if at some barbaric jest </s>
<s> Ruined </s>
<s> She had turned quite white </s>
<s> Oh she cried wetting her lips does it mean there is nothing left </s>
<s> How did it happen </s>
<s> Oh it can't be true </s>
<s> How did it happen </s>
<s> Willoughby had thrust both hands into his pockets and his head was turned sideways as if the better to study the depths of her emotion </s>
<s> Oh the usual wayflying too many kites I suppose </s>
<s> Poor </s>
<s> he growled savagely </s>
<s> Yes we're poor as Job's turkey </s>
<s> They've cleaned me out of everythingtheirTeton Sisters too </s>
<s> In her mind's bewilderment of distress she caught at the name it was the property in which Severance had lost his money and she recalled ugly rumors that before had not affected her </s>
<s> Now that his money was gone they attached to themselves a newer significance accusing and indefensible </s>
<s> The Teton Sisters </s>
<s> What do you mean </s>
<s> For was the shame of losing his wealth to be coupled with the shameful admission that he had taken a hand in gouging her former suitor </s>
<s> It was singular she hadn't thought of it before now it struck home with redoubled poignancy </s>
<s> Mean hey </s>
<s> I mean they've got it away from meMills and that fellow Severance </s>
<s> It was the prettiest thing I owned too he groaned careless of what he was saying and blurting out the acknowledgment </s>
<s> But that ain't the worstno not by a long chalk </s>
<s> Do you know what they're going to do </s>
<s> he demanded hoarsely and with an almost weeping resentment yet as if glad to find some one to whom to pour it out </s>
<s> They're going to sue for the money too </s>
<s> What money </s>
<s> she persisted hollowly determined now to know all </s>
<s> It might be dreadful to lose one's moneyit was dreadful but to have this man drag her down into his own shame tooah </s>
<s> Willoughby threw up both hands in a gesture of ungovernable petulance </s>
<s> Oh what's the use of talking about it </s>
<s> he growled and then instantly his voice dropped </s>
<s> Stella I'm sorry for your sake </s>
<s> We'll have to begin all over again dear </s>
<s> But you shall talk of it </s>
<s> she directed with a cruel and cutting significance in her voice </s>
<s> You can't hide it from me now </s>
<s> His mouth opened dumbfoundedly </s>
<s> Then he thrust out his jaw with a reawakened truculency now aimed at her </s>
<s> Well thenit was the money I took from that fellowfrom your old friend Severance </s>
<s> He was You took it from him </s>
<s> she cried </s>
<s> You mean you STOLE it </s>
<s> Willoughby's mouth twitched as if she had struck him a blow </s>
<s> So that's the way you look at it now is it </s>
<s> he said his voice quietly effective </s>
<s> All right then </s>
<s> I came in here hoping to get a word of sympathy from youperhaps a little kindness </s>
<s> But I knew it was only a hope </s>
<s> He drew a deep breath </s>
<s> Now don't work yourself up over him I warn you my dear </s>
<s> I won't tell you why I ruined him years ago but I'll tell you how </s>
<s> You've called me a thief so I'll give you some more facts before you jump at conclusions </s>
<s> I don't want excusesit's explanations </s>
<s> It was another taunt that struck home but Willoughby again mastered himself grimly </s>
<s> Any one of us would have done it he answered ignoring the remark </s>
<s> Severance made it easy </s>
<s> I did to him only what he tried to do to others </s>
<s> When he saw how good the mine was he wanted me to help him rook them out of their stock so that we could get it </s>
<s> Simple enough of course but they'd been square with me </s>
<s> No I refusedbut I did accommodate him to the extent of doing him out of his own block </s>
<s> He'd mortgaged everything to buy shares and when he was where I wanted him all tied up with loans and not able to borrow another cent I told the mine people what Severance was trying to do </s>
<s> So they put in a ruinous report and every one from whom he'd borrowed a cent just called his loans and foreclosed on him right and left </s>
<s> He went down and outand that's all there was to it </s>
<s> Nobody else got hurt and we divided his stock among us </s>
<s> Can't you see how it was Stella </s>
<s> he asked quietly and stood awaiting her verdict </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> I see how it was </s>
<s> she flashed </s>
<s> It was robberyyou can't excuse yourself </s>
<s> If she had wished to sting him again the attempt seemed to become fruitful </s>
<s> Excuses </s>
<s> I make none do you hear </s>
<s> he retorted incensed </s>
<s> I ruined him to get him out of your wayyes!oh you needn't say it!out of mine too </s>
<s> Look here </s>
<s> he cried passionately don't you think I didn't know you </s>
<s> All you looked for or lived for was But he broke off there and surveyed her with an affronted dullness as if it were only wasted effort </s>
<s> Oh well what's the use </s>
<s> he muttered and with morose and glowering eyes slouched through the doorway </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby lay among the pillows her arms flung out and her face half hidden by her disordered hair </s>
<s> TO BE POOR </s>
<s> Her mind seized on that as the one incalculable shame that had befallen heron that rather than on her view of his dishonesty </s>
<s> Curiously enough it was not only the loss of the money itself and the imminent surrender of her ease and luxury and ostentation that dismayed her </s>
<s> She was anguished as well by the stigma of being poor </s>
<s> She was able to see only the mean side of it the pity of her friends already rang in her ears like scorn mocking her because the one thing that had made her was now stripped away </s>
<s> Hers was not the nature to see the other side of itthe helpful nobility of selfdenial the heroism of unselfishness the courage that stoically faces the narrow and sordid effort whose rewards are only in the future </s>
<s> No indeed!there was only a savage resentment in her mind the inexplicable sense that somehow she had been tricked and cheated and that he alone was to blame </s>
<s> Though she accused him of dishonesty in the Severance affair the charge was only secondary </s>
<s> Given another time she might carelessly have acquitted him taking his own sayso as enough but Willoughby now had chosen a poor hour for his acknowledgment when he linked it to the tidings of his ruin </s>
<s> All that day she kept to her bed her mind absorbed with the catastrophe that had swept out from under her the unsolid prop of her arrogant money pride </s>
<s> For again without money what was left </s>
<s> She showed herself the day following wan and silent </s>
<s> Willoughby was away the news of his failure was public property and she writhed when she read of it in the daily prints </s>
<s> But in the following days she suffered other pangs that were a healthy counterirritantshe learned to pick and number her FRIENDS and to know among so large a list of acquaintances how very few they were </s>
<s> Though she was prepared for this well aware what befalls the one with broken playthings nevertheless she was filled with bitter exasperation against those who were no more careless than she had been herself </s>
<s> So she left orders with the servants that none was to be admitted </s>
<s> Her husband was not so easily evaded </s>
<s> He returned three days later and walking straight to her laid a hand on her shoulder </s>
<s> Stella I'm mighty sorry but if you'll help me I can get on my feet again </s>
<s> Oh don't bother me </s>
<s> she retorted flinging off his hand </s>
<s> Willoughby flushed seemed about to make a bitter retort and apparently changed his mind </s>
<s> Stella I'm in a good deal of trouble </s>
<s> A kind word or two would help </s>
<s> But the wife maintained a sullen dumbness her eyes turned away from him and Willoughby retired shaking his head </s>
<s> At the week end he tried again hopefully </s>
<s> Stella it's not so bad as we first thought </s>
<s> I think we'll save enough to live onmaybe enough to keep our home </s>
<s> But you'll have to lend a hand </s>
<s> She looked up from her packing </s>
<s> What do you say </s>
<s> she demanded with a rekindled interest and at the sight of it his eyes lightened </s>
<s> Why if you're willing to go slowly and put up with a few things we might be able to do it </s>
<s> Humh </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby bent over her trunk again </s>
<s> I suppose that means you'd make me a kind of drudge </s>
<s> Thank you I prefer the other way </s>
<s> The other way </s>
<s> he inquired looking at her closely </s>
<s> What do you mean by that </s>
<s> She affected to show her carelessness by smoothing the clothes in the trunk tray </s>
<s> Oh I'm going to take the boy and go away somewhere for a while </s>
<s> It was not unexpected </s>
<s> Willoughby came a step nearer his brow wrinkled ominously </s>
<s> You shall not </s>
<s> he said with a slow distinctness every syllable rapped out decisively </s>
<s> Then his anger righteous enough in its way got the better of him </s>
<s> Listen to me Stella!' he gritted clenching his hands beside him </s>
<s> I can see clear through you </s>
<s> You haven't the nerve to face this down so you're going to sling me overboard </s>
<s> That's it isn't it </s>
<s> Well you sha'n't </s>
<s> I've handled you like a fool these years and now I'm going to take charge </s>
<s> You'll stay herenot because of yourself or mebut for the boy </s>
<s> he cried and Mrs. Willoughby arose quiet but white </s>
<s> No she answered clearly we've played this farce too long Harmon </s>
<s> I don't think I'm suited to you and I'm sure you're not suited to me </s>
<s> We married under false ideas of each other </s>
<s> Willoughby turned white too but restraining himself he peered at her from under his heavy brows </s>
<s> No we didn't </s>
<s> he retorted solemnly </s>
<s> YOU did but _I_ didn't </s>
<s> You married me thinking my money would buy you what you wanted </s>
<s> I question whether you thought of ME at all </s>
<s> But I married you Stella knowing exactly what you were and since I've paid for it I intend you shall stick to your bargain </s>
<s> Oh yes she answered smiling a little in scorn it would be like you to call it a bargain </s>
<s> But you can't prevent my leaving </s>
<s> Noperhaps not but I can give you a good strong argument why you shouldn't </s>
<s> Don't think I'm the only one that knows youwhy good Lord Stella I've no monopoly on the knowledge </s>
<s> Do you know what they'll say of you all these fair weather friends that've dropped you like a smashed toy </s>
<s> _I_ DOthey'll say you've wrung me dry and that now I'm ruined you've chucked me just as they thought you would </s>
<s> If you care to know I've heard whispers of it already so I'm going to save my boy if I can </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby stood with a hand at her throat gasping the shot had struck home </s>
<s> How dare you </s>
<s> she whispered </s>
<s> How dare you after what I know of you </s>
<s> You say that after cheating me into marrying you </s>
<s> Willoughby tossed his head </s>
<s> Do you still refer to Severance </s>
<s> he inquired caustically and then his face darkened </s>
<s> I'll tell you why I cheated you into marrying me </s>
<s> It was because I loved you I think he said and there came a wistfulness into his voice that almost startled her </s>
<s> But she put it away scornfully </s>
<s> You mean you stole his money to get me </s>
<s> she retorted unequivocally </s>
<s> I didyou're quite right </s>
<s> he answered quickly </s>
<s> And do you know what became of the money </s>
<s> he demanded pausing long enough to wet his lips but giving her no time to reply Well it bought the clothes you woreyour hatsyour glovesyour jewels </s>
<s> It's paid for your extravagancesor a part of them </s>
<s> It bought you the carriage you wanted your string of pearls too </s>
<s> My soul </s>
<s> he cried in a kind of fierce wonderment it bought nearly all there is of you I think </s>
<s> It bought you besidesthat money didhis with a lot more added to it </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby stared at him confoundedthe situation had become reversed </s>
<s> She found herself impugned and called to defend when she had thought only to attack </s>
<s> It was a bitter reflection that he had all along hidden his contempt while she had been idly picking flaws in him </s>
<s> Oh yes </s>
<s> he cried going on all you looked for or lived for was money </s>
<s> I'd heard your father drum it into your head and I'd seen the way you took it in </s>
<s> He threw up his hand with a gesture of intolerable regret this man who had been only a moneygrubbing automaton </s>
<s> I was ashamed at first but as you'd seemed to take a fancy to me I deluded myself into thinking you cared </s>
<s> I knew Severance too </s>
<s> He was clever and shrewd but crooked as a fishhook </s>
<s> At the time he was making love to you there was another </s>
<s> But never mind I won't talk of that </s>
<s> I saw you and it didn't take long to turn my head </s>
<s> He smiled wistfully as before </s>
<s> I'd never seen a woman like you you know </s>
<s> I'd been too busy trying to keep alive </s>
<s> But there was this Severance andoh well what's the use </s>
<s> he muttered again thickly </s>
<s> You got your money and I got the woman I loved </s>
<s> Yes I got hermy soul </s>
<s> he protested and it's a pretty trial balance isn't it to cast up on a day like this </s>
<s> Silenced she stood and watched him waiting for the next storm of his passion </s>
<s> But Willoughby's rage seemed to have burned itself out </s>
<s> He drifted across the room and reached his hand for the bellpull </s>
<s> Put away that trunk he ordered quietly facing her I'm going to run things now </s>
<s> If you're determined to leave me you'll have to put it off a while </s>
<s> I'm going to save the boy </s>
<s> When I'm on my feet again I'll give you what money you want but there shall be no open scandal </s>
<s> Still silent she was watching him when the maid came in answer to the bell </s>
<s> Help Mrs. Willoughby with these he said curtly denoting the halfpacked trunk we're not going away </s>
<s> And in the presence of the servant she dared make no rejoinder </s>
<s> Later in the day he looked in again Mrs. Willoughby and the maid were rearranging the room and the trunk had been whisked away </s>
<s> He smiled grimly and withdrew </s>
<s> There could be but two results from a conflict like this she would either scorn him the more or she would come to respect him </s>
<s> For days the outcome wavered in the balance </s>
<s> They met at the table onlyshe sitting preoccupied he talking quietly with the boy </s>
<s> At the week end he brought her a roll of bills </s>
<s> For the house money he said briefly and when she would not reach out a hand for it he dropped it in her lap and went away </s>
<s> But that night she entered into the talk at the table a little quiet still repressed and showing her hurt </s>
<s> Willoughby quietly deferential kept to his part of the conversation exactly as if nothing ugly had occurred between them </s>
<s> His bantering with his son was genial and affectionate and once she thought he tried to include her in this camaraderie </s>
<s> The few last shreds of her vanity however still waved distressing signals of the hurt and she evaded it </s>
<s> But she felt strangely alone notwithstanding with an almost unconquerable selfpity she reflected on the fairweather friends that had deserted her </s>
<s> A little sense of comfort trickled into her heart though when she thought of her boy </s>
<s> HE at all events had not been affected by the rumble of drums that had beaten her out of the worldly camp where once she had commanded </s>
<s> That night Willoughby looked in at her while she sat musing over a book and when she would not look up at him he went away again </s>
<s> A more complete sense of her loneliness came over her as the hours passed in the big silent house </s>
<s> So she laid down her book and went upstairs to her boy's room </s>
<s> Who's there </s>
<s> he cried awakening from a doze </s>
<s> Just I Willard </s>
<s> I came up to see whether you were all right </s>
<s> Oh yes I am </s>
<s> he answered a little perplexed it had not been often that she had found time from her busy affairs for a visit like this </s>
<s> The boy took her hand in his and snuggled down in the pillows </s>
<s> It's nice to have you mumsy he mumbled comfortably </s>
<s> Willoughby coming home the next evening heard her talking to the cook </s>
<s> You mustn't be so wasteful Annie </s>
<s> Unless you can do better I shall have to get some one else </s>
<s> Her voice was peevish but to Willoughby it sounded full of inexplicable melody </s>
<s> Nor when she carried her complaint to him later at the dinnertable was he less affected with a secret joy </s>
<s> Harmonwe'd better take a smaller house </s>
<s> I can't do it any longer on what we have </s>
<s> You needn't he answered lightly I can let you have more </s>
<s> Things are working out better than I expected </s>
<s> Just let me know what you're short at the end of the week </s>
<s> I can manage it </s>
<s> That night too he came and sat in the room where she was reading </s>
<s> He said nothing and picked up another book </s>
<s> But she knew what he wished and resolutely steeled herself </s>
<s> The next night he was there again </s>
<s> Good night dear he said cheerfully daring the added word when she arose to go </s>
<s> Good night she answered </s>
<s> But on the evening following they talked together each evading the shoals of past regret and threading only the safe channels of the commonplace </s>
<s> Good night Stella dear he said unaffectedly as she picked up her things and she answered Good night Harmon </s>
<s> He came close to her and looked down into her face </s>
<s> Stella he said quietly Stella it would make me very happy if youif I mightwhy kiss you good night </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby gathered up the remainder of her things and then slowly shook her head </s>
<s> No we won't talk of thatyet </s>
<s> she answered and went away up the stairs </s>
<s> Willoughby bit his lip looking silently after her </s>
<s> Why mumsy </s>
<s> exclaimed the boy his hand touching his mother's cheek as she leaned over him </s>
<s> What's wrong </s>
<s> She shook her head vehemently in the dark </s>
<s> Nothing at all dear </s>
<s> You must go to sleep now </s>
<s> The next day Willoughby on his return from downtown found her busily superintending the two servants while they cleaned up his room </s>
<s> It was an unexpected attention on her part </s>
<s> He withdrew quietly </s>
<s> A little while later leaning over the balusters she saw Willard whispering to him earnestly </s>
<s> Did she my boy </s>
<s> she heard the man cry under his breath </s>
<s> Why now mumsy must just have been a little tired </s>
<s> I don't think it was anything else </s>
<s> Willoughby's smile seemed enough at the moment to reassure almost any one </s>
<s> At dinner his lightness goodnature geniality became infectious </s>
<s> Even Mrs. Willoughby suffered herself to smile at his whimsical jollity with the boy </s>
<s> Later there was the little comedy of the good night and then they parted again </s>
<s> But Willoughby did not go out as usual </s>
<s> It was very late that night when Mrs. Willoughby awoke with the conviction that some one was in her room </s>
<s> Her first impulse was to cry out in alarm then in terror she lay quiet peering from beneath her halfclosed lids </s>
<s> Across the lighter background of the curtained window a figure moved big and familiar in its bulk </s>
<s> She knew then and there seemed a greater reason than ever why she should remain quiet </s>
<s> Nor was she wrong in her surmise </s>
<s> A moment later Willoughby leaned over and she felt his lips lightly brush her cheek </s>
<s> A little sigh followed and then he was gone tiptoeing cautiously </s>
<s> Mrs. Willoughby sat up in bed her face in her hands and reflected in the stillness that presages the storm </s>
<s> But loneliness no longer pained her the solitude had become suddenly peopled with vivid poignant regrets shouting loudly their indictment and their appeal </s>

<s> Vol. XXIII No.1 JULY 1910 The Painter of Diana of the Tides pages 95103 By WALTER PRICHARD EATON Author of The American Stage of Today etc </s>
<s> Given nearly three hundred square feet of blank wall space and it takes something of an artist to fill it up with interesting paint </s>
<s> Probably you would not pick a miniature painter for the task </s>
<s> Yet curiously John Elliott creator of Diana of the Tides the great mural painting which adorns the large gallery to the right of the entrance of the new National Museum at Washington also paints on ivory </s>
<s> He works likewise in silver point that delicate and difficult medium he draws pastel illustrations for children's fairy tales he works in portraiture with red chalk or oils </s>
<s> And when the need comes he has shown that he can turn stevedore carpenter and architect to slave with the relief party at Messina finally to help design and build in four months an entire village for the stricken sufferers including a hotel a hospital three schoolhouses and a church </s>
<s> The too frequent scorn of the practical man of affairs for the artist and dreamer the world's sneaking tolerance for the temperament which creates in forms of ideal beauty rather than in bridges or factories or banks finds in the life and work of such a man as John Elliott such complete if unconscious refutation that his story should have its place in the history of the day </s>
<s> John Elliott was born on Good Friday 1859 one of a famous Scottish border family </s>
<s> His residence is now in Boston Massachusetts at the home of his motherinlaw </s>
<s> Mrs. Julia Ward Howe </s>
<s> Robert Louis Stevenson had Elliott blood in his veins </s>
<s> Parts of me he once wrote have shouted the slogan of the Elliotts in the debatable land </s>
<s> If Stevenson's Homeric account of the Four Black Elliotts in Weir of Hermiston is historically veracious we might fancy that one of their descendants would feel his activities somewhat cramped on Beacon Street Boston </s>
<s> The Elliotts were a wild lot and some of them did not escape the hangman </s>
<s> Their family tree appears to have been the gallows </s>
<s> But Stevenson tells us they were noted for their prayers and at least one of them wrote poetry and declaimed it drunk to Walter Scott who retaliated in kind </s>
<s> But the present John Elliott artist though he is of the kin of Stevenson and bears the dark hair and rather prominent melancholy eyes of the traditional Elliott stock yet physically much more closely resembles Edgar Allan Poe </s>
<s> If you press him hard he will confess that he began life by studying for the stage and almost played Romeo before painting drew him away </s>
<s> Reaching Italy he aspired to enter the studio of Don Jose di Villegas now director of the Prado Museum in Madrid but then in Rome </s>
<s> Villegas took no pupils </s>
<s> But Jack Elliott is Scotch </s>
<s> He made a bargain </s>
<s> He would teach the master English in return for instruction in painting </s>
<s> At the end of two years young Elliott had learned much about art but the master he says had acquired only one English phraseI haf no money </s>
<s> At the end of two years Elliott wished to leave because he despaired of painting like his master </s>
<s> That is why I keep you said Villegas you have retained your own manner and choice of subjects </s>
<s> So the pupil stayed on in Rome for five years sharing his studio later with Aristide Sartorio now a leading Italian painter </s>
<s> Here in the Via Flaminia he painted his first important mural decoration for the dining room of Mrs. Potter Palmer's Chicago Lake Shore mansion </s>
<s> This work called The Vintage is decorously inebriate a vinous riot of little cupids </s>
<s> It led shortly after his marriage in 1887 to Miss Maud Howe a daughter of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe to his establishing himself in Chicago where he did many decorations and portraits </s>
<s> In 1894 he went back to Rome to execute a commission for a huge ceiling piece for the Boston Public Library </s>
<s> The piece was for a room later converted into a children's room and after the canvas was placed in 1901 the incongruity of the adult painting and the purposes of the room caused unfavorable comment </s>
<s> But the room has been recently readjusted </s>
<s> It is now lined with high oak shelves almost to the cornice filled with musty old books of a beautiful brownperhaps the most effective decoration in the worldand the ceiling tells at its true value </s>
<s> This ceiling fifty feet square divided into two equal panels represents the twenty Christian centuries as horses led by the hours winged female figures out of the mists of the past into the illumination of the present </s>
<s> The models for the horses were the undersized nags of the Roman Campagna which are small but decorative beasties as Mr. Elliott puts it and lend themselves to a slightly conventional treatment </s>
<s> They sweep two by two out of a cool mistiness round the ceiling past the suggestion of a pale moon into the full radiance of the golden orb of the sun </s>
<s> The triumph of the picture is its handling of the problem of light </s>
<s> This golden daybreak pierces the mists whereon the horses gallop touches here a flank there a wing feather on one of the hours and warms to rosy glow the tip of a cloud </s>
<s> It appears in unexpected places grows where only shadow seemed to be and surprises you anew each time you look up </s>
<s> Painted in the flatthat is with no part of the picture telling as farther from the eye than another to distort the proportions of the roomthe ceiling yet has great depth distance airy lightness </s>
<s> It is a true decorative painting </s>
<s> While at work upon it Mr. Elliott painted many portraits including the wellknown red chalk heads of the Soldiers Three Lord Ava the Marquis of Winchester and General Wauchope the portrait of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge and that of Lady Katherine Thynne now Lady Cromer a celebrated English beauty </s>
<s> Indeed he made her the model for the second hour in the Boston ceiling the figure next to the leader in the procession </s>
<s> Three studies of her head for this figure well known from reproduction are now in the possession of Thomas W </s>
<s> Lawson </s>
<s> In Rome the Elliotts occupied for some time the apartments of Mrs. Elliott's cousin the late F </s>
<s> Marion Crawford in the Palazzo Santa Croce </s>
<s> In writing With the Immortals Mr. Crawford had collected many death masks including one of Dante which fascinated Mr. Elliott </s>
<s> Two pictures of Dante in Exile were the result </s>
<s> One of them now hangs in the living room of Queen Margherita of Italy the other in the house of Mrs. J </s>
<s> Montgomery Sears of Boston </s>
<s> A third pastel study was made an unfinished head of the poet and thrown into a wastebasket </s>
<s> By a curious fatality it is now better known than either of the paintings </s>
<s> Mrs. Elliott rescued the drawing smoothed it out framed it and was allowed to hang it in her chamber </s>
<s> Later it was seen and purchased by Mrs. David Kimball of Boston and in reproduction has gone all over the world receiving honors in Japan and the higher honor of a place over the desk of many Dante students </s>
<s> Yet few who possess the reproduction know anything of the artist </s>
<s> Mr. Elliott receiving his commission to do a great mural painting for the new National Museum in Washington again went to Rome four years ago </s>
<s> Diana of the Tides was completed and signed on Christmas day 1908 </s>
<s> Three days later came the awful news of the Messina earthquake and the Hon </s>
<s> Lloyd Griscom then American Ambassador to Italy at once called for volunteers for his relief expedition </s>
<s> John Elliott was among the first to respond </s>
<s> He went south officially as an interpreter </s>
<s> Actually he played the part of stevedore as well for ten days on the relief ship </s>
<s> I have dropped my last knuckle down the hold this morning he wrote back and I have only two fingers left that I can wash </s>
<s> After a few weeks he hastened back to Rome to give a promised public exhibition of Diana of the Tides and as soon as the exhibition was over rushed down to Messina again </s>
<s> There Commander Belknap who was at the head of the American relief forces put him to work as architect on the erection of the American village in the lemon groves on the outskirts of the stricken city </s>
<s> I had never been trained as an architect he says but I once made over a house up in Cornish New Hampshire and that gave me a practical experience which came in remarkably handy </s>
<s> Most of the lumber had been cut for the erection of small houses and the door and window frames were stock pieces </s>
<s> It became his task to design and build as quickly as could be done not only comfortable houses for many thousand people but a church a hotel three schools a hospital all out of these small lumber units </s>
<s> He combined the units for the larger buildings so grouping the small stock window frames as to give a pleasing effect of size even constructing a kind of rose window for the church </s>
<s> He helped lay out the streets in such a way as to preserve all the trees possible </s>
<s> And in spite of the haste with which the work had to he done and the sixteenhouraday strain under which the workers labored the Zona Americana emerged an attractive and sanitary as well as practical village </s>
<s> Queen Helena as soon as the American village was under way got Mr. Elliott to go over the drafts for the plans of the American quarter in her village near by working them up along the same lines </s>
<s> So in four months he designed and superintended the erection of houses churches schools and hospitals for a town of several thousand inhabitants </s>
<s> Commander Belknap's report spoke of him as the first to volunteer and the most devoted worker sharing every hardship with unfailing good humor and leaving his beautifying touch on every part of the work </s>
<s> On June 12 1908 having built his town and recovered his lost knuckles John Elliott returned to Rome where the soil did not rock and set quietly about making twentyfour small pastel drawings to illustrate a fairy story </s>
<s> From building houses for the wretched homeless sufferers he turned to the play tales of childhood </s>
<s> He laid down the T square and the hammer for a piece of pastel crayon </s>
<s> But he had triumphantly refuted the scorn of the practical man for the artist </s>
<s> He had shown the stuff that dreams are really made of </s>
<s> Incidentally he had won for himself a decoration from the King of Italy and the medal of the American Red Cross Association </s>
<s> Diana of the Tides which now covers the end wall of the righthand gallery of the new National Museum at Washington is akin to the Boston Library ceiling in its employment of horses symbolically its light luminous color and its subtle play of illumination </s>
<s> This charm of illumination is unfortunately lost in reproduction </s>
<s> Mr. Elliott has made symbolic use of Diana the Moon Goddess </s>
<s> in a way obvious enough but hitherto oddly untried by artists </s>
<s> It is a way singularly appropriate in a museum of scientific charactera combination of ancient myth and modern science </s>
<s> As the Moon Goddess Diana controls the four tides which in the shape of horses draw her erect and jubilant figure on a great seashell </s>
<s> They are without guiding reins and harness to suggest the unseen channels of her sway </s>
<s> If the reader will note an advancing wave he will see that just before the crest curls over the foam is tossed back </s>
<s> Then the wave bows and breaks </s>
<s> So the nearest horse raises his head slightly the next higher the third tosses his head back and the last has bowed his neck </s>
<s> In their motion and grouped attitudes </s>
<s> as they gallop up on the beach is the rhythm of an oncoming wave </s>
<s> Farther than that Mr. Elliott wisely did not go </s>
<s> Let them suggest more obviously a wave he says and you have a trick picture </s>
<s> After a while you wouldn't see anything in it but the trick </s>
<s> The wave motion is repeated on a comber out at sea and to the left against a rock on the shore </s>
<s> Diana stands behind the horses against the great golden moona radiant halo </s>
<s> She has just unloosed an arrow from her bow </s>
<s> Her draperies are of indefinite color the rose and lilac and amber of sunset </s>
<s> Her face it will be noted though she stands against the moon is lighted from in front </s>
<s> In that fact lies the secret of the illumination </s>
<s> For this picture was supposedly painted at that one Byronic hour of the year when The sun was setting opposite the moon </s>
<s> Turner in a small water color has worked out a similar problem with the cool copper of the harvest moonlight bathing one side of an old stone tower the warm rose of sunset the other </s>
<s> In Mr. Elliott's great canvas the mutual lights kill all shadows and out toward the great yellow disk of the moon the invisible sun floods its lilac and pink kindling the waves the draperies of the goddess the wet flanks of the horses and suffusing the whole painting with its delicate bright warmth which is yet kept too cool for gaudiness by the twilight of the moon </s>
<s> While this canvas was being unpacked in Washington last winter Mr. Elliott was exhibiting in Boston his portrait of his motherinlaw Mrs. Julia Ward Howe </s>
<s> It was begun and nearly finished at Newport four or five years ago but Mr. Elliott has not cared to complete it for during the interval the Grand Old Lady has considerably changed in appearance </s>
<s> She is now more than ninety years old </s>
<s> When the sittings began Mrs. Howe had just recovered from an illness and could read or talk only for brief periods </s>
<s> Mostly she sat looking out of her window at a bird which had a nest in a nearby tree </s>
<s> In this attitude the eyes raised the face quiet yet alert the artist has caught her calm patient but with one hand characteristically clenched on the arm of her chair showing a touch of hidden force and commanding will </s>
<s> She is dressed in light green </s>
<s> The background is an indistinguishable brown </s>
<s> Her eyes have that very delicate light blue of advanced age wistful yet prophetic </s>
<s> The skin too has the rare ivory delicacy of old age of old age gently dealt with and protected </s>
<s> The light is unobtrusive yet luminousmorning sunshine </s>
<s> The picture is utterly simple the more so for its touch of incompleteness </s>
<s> The masses are broad artless </s>
<s> It is tender reverential a sweet and solemn glorification of old age and of the old age of a distinguished spirit </s>
<s> And at the exhibition in Boston one of the women visitors complained to the artist But you know Mr. Elliott when Mrs. Howe comes to the Woman's Club she always looks so bright and animated and always has something smart to say </s>
<s> To which the artist replied No doubt my dear lady </s>
<s> But I was not painting a president of the New England Woman's Club but the author of `The Battle Hymn of the Republic.' Queen Margherita of Italy made a truer comment when she saw the portrait in Mr. Elliott's studio in Rome </s>
<s> That portrait deserves to go into any collection in the world she said not because it is a good portrait of a distinguished old woman but because it is a portrait of Old age as it ought to be </s>
<s> Can it be that a mere Continental Queen is a better judge of art than a member of a Boston Woman's Club </s>
<s> Such thoughts are very disturbing </s>
<s> Queen Margherita ever since she first visited Mr. Elliott's studio in Rome ten years ago has been his warm patron </s>
<s> It was for her he made his well known silverpoint portrait of the late King Humbert which she carries with her on all journeys </s>
<s> It has indeed the boldness of line inseparable from good silverpoint drawing where a stroke once laid on is indelible and no working over is possible </s>
<s> When Diana of the Tides was exhibited in Rome in February 1909 the Queen was one of the first visitors </s>
<s> She was not the first the Chinese Minister arriving ahead of all others on the stroke of tenthe opening hourattended by all his suite to signify his profound Celestial veneration for the Fine Arts </s>
<s> The Queen seeing the picture expressed delight and volunteered to tell her son King Victor Emmanuel about it </s>
<s> A few days later at seven thirty in the morning there came a knocking at the door with the announcement A message from the King </s>
<s> The King said the messenger would follow in an hour </s>
<s> Presumably there was some hurry of preparation in the Elliott family </s>
<s> A New York artist at any rate at seven thirty A </s>
<s> M. would be in no condition to receive a crowned heador any other </s>
<s> Promptly at eight thirtypunctuality being a royal virtueKing Victor Emmanuel drove up in a motor car with two aides </s>
<s> He remained half an hour </s>
<s> Being fond of horses he found much in the picture genuinely to interest him </s>
<s> The artist accompanied the monarch to the door of his car where he thanked him for the honor of his visit </s>
<s> Not at all said the King in his excellent English </s>
<s> My mother told me to come </s>
<s> Which shows at least that the Fifth Commandment is honored in Italy </s>
<s> The twentyfour pastel drawings made to illustrate Mrs. Anderson's fairy tale The Great Sea Horse were also exhibited in America last winter </s>
<s> Made immediately after Mr. Elliott's heartbreaking labor on the rocking soil of Sicily they are none the less quiet childish and fanciful in their charm </s>
<s> Only one of them might have been inspired by the turning over in his uneasy sleep of the giant buried beneath Etnathe picture of the naked giant sitting on a headland and emptying his hot pipe ashes into the sea where they form a volcano </s>
<s> The grim grotesque old fellow is carefully drawn with a fine rhythm of line in the seated limbs </s>
<s> His bulk dwarfs the headland and his head and shoulders grow blue and pale in the sky </s>
<s> One questions why the ashes do not fall farther out to sea they seem to lie in the shallow tide water on the beach </s>
<s> Barring this note of smallness the picture is a true grotesque in miniature </s>
<s> Mr. Elliott also works in genuine miniature </s>
<s> He has painted several portraitsof Mrs. Potter Palmer the Chanler sisters of New York and many more </s>
<s> He has painted landscapes as well </s>
<s> Professor Barrett Wendell possesses a charming example </s>
<s> Most recently he has been engaged on a large mural decoration best fitted perhaps for a music room showing Pan seated on a tree trunk by a lake making into a pipe the broken reeds in his hand after Syrinx eluded him </s>
<s> No horizon line shows </s>
<s> Pan and his tawny leopard skin his automobile coat the artist calls it tell against the high purple banks across the lake </s>
<s> The god is making the best of his lossmaking music of it in fact </s>
<s> He was the eternal boy before Mr. Barrie rediscovered him and surnamed him Peter </s>
<s> And there is something of the eternal boy about John Elliott </s>
<s> He plays with a paint box on a fiftyfoot ceiling or a twentyseven foot end wall turns aside to paint a miniature on ivory drops all his paints when a great national calamity comes and is converted into an architect overnight building a whole town in four months and making it as beautiful as he can in the process though the practical man would say that utility alone was demanded and then when this work is over turning blithely back again to make pictures for a fairy book </s>
<s> He is strong through his fresh imagination to combine ancient myth with modern science in a huge decorative canvas to reflect the dignity and loveliness and spiritual power of an exalted old age to do practical work in a practical crisisand to joy at the same time with the moon baby dancing on the beach </s>
<s> Jack Elliott they will tell you who know him has an artistic temperament </s>
<s> Well if this be the artistic temperament what a pity there is not more of it in the world </s>
<s> It is not the temperament that is selfcentered whining ineffectual </s>
<s> It is the temperament that does whatever comes to hand as well as it can for sheer love of the task and of beautiful workmanship that through imagination wins to sympathy and through imagination grasps the opportunity to do practical work beautifully where others would only do it practically </s>
<s> It is the temperament eternally boyish and buoyant which is on the side of sweetness and light </s>
<s> Perhaps it is not what the world means by the artistic temperament </s>
<s> But it is the temperament of the true artist </s>
<s> Never do a potboiler said Mr. Elliott to a young painter the other day </s>
<s> Let one of your best things go to boil the pot </s>
<s> In these words is a rule of conduct that all of usartists or artisans brokers or clerks men or womenmight well walk by toward the light of a more beautiful and cooperative society </s>
<s> Vol. XXIII No.2 AUGUST 1910 THE HEATHEN page 193204 By JACK LONDON Author of The Call of the Wild Martin Eden etc </s>
<s> I met him first in a hurricane </s>
<s> And though we had been through the hurricane on the same schooner it was not until the schooner had gone to pieces under us that I first laid eyes on him </s>
<s> Without doubt I had seen him with the rest of the Kanaka crew on board but I had not consciously been aware of his existence for the Petite Jeanne was rather overcrowded </s>
<s> In addition to her eight or ten Kanaka sea men her white captain mate and supercargo and her six cabin passengers she sailed from Rangiroa with something like eightyfive deck passengersPaumotuans and Tahitians men women and children each with a tradebox to say nothing of sleepingmats blankets and clothesbundles </s>
<s> The pearling season in the Paumotus was over and all hands were returning to Tahiti </s>
<s> The six of us cabin passengers were pearlbuyers </s>
<s> Two were Americans one was Ah Choon the whitest Chinese I have ever known one was a German one was a Polish Jew and I completed the halfdozen </s>
<s> It had been a prosperous season </s>
<s> Not one of us had cause for complaint nor one of the eightyfive deck passengers either </s>
<s> All had done well and all were looking forward to a restoff and a good time in Papeete </s>
<s> Of course the Petite Jeanne was overloaded </s>
<s> he was only seventy tons and she had no right to carry a tithe of the mob she had on board </s>
<s> Beneath her hatches she was crammed and jammed with pearl shell and copra </s>
<s> Even the traderoom was packed full of shell </s>
<s> It was a miracle that the sailors could work her </s>
<s> There was no moving about the decks </s>
<s> They simply climbed back and forth along the rails </s>
<s> In the nighttime they walked upon the sleepers who carpeted the deck two deep I'll swear </s>
<s> Oh and there were pigs and chickens on deck and sacks of yams while every conceivable place was festooned with strings of drinking cocoanuts and bunches of bananas </s>
<s> On both sides between the fore and main shrouds guys had been stretched just low enough for the foreboom to swing clear and from each of these guys at least fifty bunches of bananas were suspended </s>
<s> It promised to be a messy passage even if we did make it in the two or three days that would have been required if the southeast trades had been blowing fresh </s>
<s> But they weren't blowing fresh </s>
<s> After the first five hours the trade died away in a dozen gasping fans </s>
<s> The calm continued all that night and the next dayone of those glaring glossy calms when the very thought of opening one's eyes to look at it is sufficient to cause a headache </s>
<s> The second day a man died an Easter Islander one of the best divers that season in the lagoon </s>
<s> Smallpox that is what it was though how smallpox could come on board when there had been no known cases ashore when we left Rangiroa is beyond me </s>
<s> There it was though smallpox a man dead and three others down on their backs </s>
<s> There was nothing to be done </s>
<s> We could not segregate the sick nor could we care for them </s>
<s> We were packed like sardines </s>
<s> There was nothing to do but diethat is there was nothing to do after the night that followed the first death </s>
<s> On that night the mate the supercargo the Polish Jew and four native divers sneaked away in the large whaleboat </s>
<s> They were never heard of again </s>
<s> In the morning the captain promptly scuttled the remaining boats and there we were </s>
<s> That day there were two deaths the following day three then it jumped to eight </s>
<s> It was curious to see how we took it </s>
<s> The natives for instance fell into a condition of dumb stolid fear </s>
<s> The captainOudouse his name was a Frenchmanbecame very nervous and voluble </s>
<s> The German the two Americans and myself bought up all the Scotch whisky and proceeded to drink </s>
<s> The theory was beautifulnamely if we kept ourselves soaked in alcohol every smallpox germ that came into contact with us would immediately be scorched to a cinder </s>
<s> And the theory worked though I must confess that neither Captain Oudouse nor Ah Choon was attacked by the disease either </s>
<s> The Frenchman did not drink at all while Ah Choon restricted himself to one drink daily </s>
<s> We had a week of it and then the whisky gave out </s>
<s> It was just as well or I shouldn't be alive now </s>
<s> It took a sober man to pull through what followed as you will agree when I mention the little fact that only two men did pull through </s>
<s> The other man was the Heathenat least that was what I heard Captain Oudouse call him at the moment I first became aware of the Heathen's existence </s>
<s> But to come back </s>
<s> It was at the end of the week that I happened to glance at the barometer that hung in the cabin companionway </s>
<s> Its normal register in the Paumotus was 29.90 and it was quite customary to see it vacillate between 29.85 and 30.00 or even 30.05 but to see it as I saw it down to 29.62 was sufficient to chill the blood of any pearlbuyer in Oceania </s>
<s> I called Captain Oudouse's attention to it only to be informed that he had watched it going down for several hours </s>
<s> There was little to do but that little he did very well considering the circumstances </s>
<s> He took off the light sails shortened right down to storm canvas spread lifelines and waited for the wind </s>
<s> His mistake lay in what he did after the wind came </s>
<s> He hove to on the port tack which was the right thing to do south of the Equator IFand there was the rubIF one were NOT in the direct path of the hurricane </s>
<s> We were in the direct path </s>
<s> I could see that by the steady increase of the wind and the equally steady fall of the barometer </s>
<s> I wanted to turn and run with the wind on the port quarter until the barometer ceased falling and then to heave to </s>
<s> We argued till he was reduced to hysteria but budge he would not </s>
<s> The worst of it was that I could not get the rest of the pearlbuyers to back me up </s>
<s> Who was I anyway to know more about the sea and its ways than a properly qualified captain </s>
<s> Of course the sea rose with the wind frightfully and I shall never forget the first three seas the Petite Jeanne shipped </s>
<s> She had fallen off as vessels do when hove to and the first sea made a clean breach </s>
<s> The lifelines were only for the strong and well and little good were they even for these when the women and children the bananas and cocoanuts the pigs and tradeboxes the sick and the dying were swept along in a solid screeching groaning mass </s>
<s> The second sea filled the Petite Jeanne's decks flush with the rails and as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward all the miserable dunnage of life and luggage poured aft </s>
<s> It was a human torrent </s>
<s> They came headfirst feetfirst sidewise rolling over and over twisting squirming writhing and crumpling up </s>
<s> Now and again one or another caught a grip on a stanchion or a rope but the weight of the bodies behind tore such grips loose </s>
<s> I saw what was coming sprang on top the cabin and from there into the mainsail itself </s>
<s> Ah Choon and one of the Americans tried to follow me but I was one jump ahead of them </s>
<s> The American was swept away and over the stern like a piece of chaff </s>
<s> Ah Choon caught a spoke of the wheel and swung in behind it </s>
<s> But a strapping Rarotonga vahine[1]she must have weighed two hundred and fiftybrought up against him and got an arm around his neck </s>
<s> He clutched the Kanaka steersman with his other hand </s>
<s> And just at that moment the schooner flung down to starboard </s>
<s> The rush of bodies and the sea that was coming along the port runway between the cabin and the rail turned abruptly and poured to starboard </s>
<s> Away they went vahine Ah Choon and steersman and I swear I saw Ah Choon grin at me with philosophic resignation as he cleared the rail and went under </s>
<s> [1] woman The third seathe biggest of the threedid not do so much damage </s>
<s> By the time it arrived nearly everybody was in the rigging </s>
<s> On deck perhaps a dozen gasping halfdrowned and halfstunned wretches were rolling about or attempting to crawl into safety </s>
<s> They went by the board as did the wreckage of the two remaining boats </s>
<s> The other pearlbuyers and myself between seas managed to get about fifteen women and children into the cabin and battened down </s>
<s> Little good it did the poor creatures in the end </s>
<s> Wind </s>
<s> Out of all my experiences I could not have believed it possible for the wind to blow as it did </s>
<s> There is no describing it </s>
<s> How can one describe a nightmare </s>
<s> It was the same way with that wind </s>
<s> It tore the clothes off our bodies </s>
<s> I say TORE THEM OFF and I mean it </s>
<s> I am not asking you to believe it </s>
<s> I am merely telling something that I saw and felt </s>
<s> There are times when I do not believe it myself </s>
<s> I went through it and that is enough </s>
<s> One could not face that wind and live </s>
<s> It was a monstrous thing and the most monstrous thing about it was that it increased and continued to increase </s>
<s> Imagine countless millions and billions of tons of sand </s>
<s> Imagine this sand tearing along at ninety a hundred a hundred and twenty or any other number of miles per hour </s>
<s> Imagine further this sand to be invisible impalpable yet to retain all the weight and density of sand </s>
<s> Do all this and you may get a vague inkling of what that wind was like </s>
<s> Perhaps sand is not the right comparison </s>
<s> Consider it mud invisible impalpable but heavy as mud </s>
<s> Nay it goes beyond that </s>
<s> Consider every molecule of air to be a mudbank in itself </s>
<s> Then try to imagine the multitudinous impact of mudbanksno it is beyond me </s>
<s> Language may be adequate to express the ordinary conditions of life but it cannot possibly express any of the conditions of so enormous a blast of wind </s>
<s> It would have been better had I stuck by my original intention of not attempting a description </s>
<s> I will say this much The sea which had risen at first was beaten down by that wind </s>
<s> Moreit seemed as if the whole ocean had been sucked up in the maw of the hurricane and hurled on through that portion of space which previously had been occupied by the air </s>
<s> Of course our canvas had gone long before </s>
<s> But Captain Oudouse had on the Petite Jeanne something I had never before seen on a South Sea schooner a seaanchor </s>
<s> It was a conical canvas bag the mouth of which was kept open by a huge hoop of iron </s>
<s> The seaanchor was bridled something like a kite so that it bit into the water as a kite bites into the airbut with a difference </s>
<s> The seaanchor remained just under the surface of the ocean in a perpendicular position </s>
<s> A long line in turn connected it with the schooner </s>
<s> As a result the Petite Jeanne rode bowon to the wind and to what little sea there was </s>
<s> The situation really would have been favorable had we not been in the path of the storm </s>
<s> True the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets jerked out our topmasts and made a raffle of our running gear but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing stormcenter </s>
<s> That was what fixed us </s>
<s> I was in a state of stunned numbed paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind and I think I was just about ready to give up and die when the center smote us </s>
<s> The blow we received was an absolute lull </s>
<s> There was not a breath of air </s>
<s> The effect on one was sickening </s>
<s> Remember that for hours we had been at terrific muscular tension withstanding the awful pressure of that wind </s>
<s> And then suddenly the pressure was removed </s>
<s> I know that I felt as though I were about to expand to fly apart in all directions </s>
<s> It seemed as if every atom composing my body was repelling every other atom and was on the verge of rushing off irresistibly into space </s>
<s> But that lasted only for a moment </s>
<s> Destruction was upon us </s>
<s> In the absence of the wind and its pressure the sea rose </s>
<s> It jumped it leaped it soared straight toward the clouds </s>
<s> Remember from every point of the compass that inconceivable wind was blowing in toward the center of calm </s>
<s> The result was that the seas sprang up from every point of the compass </s>
<s> There was no wind to check them </s>
<s> They popped up like corks released from the bottom of a pail of water </s>
<s> There was no system to them no stability </s>
<s> They were hollow maniacal seas </s>
<s> They were eighty feet high at the least </s>
<s> They were not seas at all </s>
<s> They resembled no sea a man had ever seen </s>
<s> They were splashes monstrous splashes that is all splashes that were eighty feet high </s>
<s> Eighty </s>
<s> They were more than eighty </s>
<s> They went over our mastheads </s>
<s> They were spouts explosions </s>
<s> They were drunken </s>
<s> They fell anywhere anyhow </s>
<s> They jostled one another they collided </s>
<s> They rushed together and collapsed upon one another or fell apart like a thousand waterfalls all at once </s>
<s> It was no ocean any man ever dreamed of that hurricanecenter </s>
<s> It was confusion thrice confounded </s>
<s> It was anarchy </s>
<s> It was a hellpit of sea water gone mad </s>
<s> The Petite Jeanne </s>
<s> I don't know </s>
<s> The Heathen told me afterward that he did not know </s>
<s> She was literally torn apart ripped wide open beaten into a pulp smashed into kindling wood annihilated </s>
<s> When I came to I was in the water swimming automatically though I was about twothirds drowned </s>
<s> How I got there I had no recollection </s>
<s> I remembered seeing the Petite Jeanne fly to pieces at what must have been the instant that my own consciousness was buffeted out of me </s>
<s> But there I was with nothing to do but make the best of it and in that best there was little promise </s>
<s> The wind was blowing again the sea was much smaller and more regular and I knew that I had passed through the center </s>
<s> Fortunately there were no sharks about </s>
<s> The hurricane had dissipated the ravenous horde that had surrounded the death ship </s>
<s> It was about midday when the Petite Jeanne went to pieces and it must have been two hours afterward when I picked up with one of her hatchcovers </s>
<s> Thick rain was driving at the time and it was the merest chance that flung me and the hatchcover together </s>
<s> A short length of line was trailing from the rope handle and I knew that I was good for a day at least if the sharks did not return </s>
<s> Three hours later possibly a little longer sticking close to the cover and with closed eyes concentrating my whole soul upon the task of breathing in enough air to keep me going and at the same time to avoid breathing in enough water to drown me it seemed to me that I heard voices </s>
<s> The rain had ceased and wind and sea were easing marvelously </s>
<s> Not twenty feet away from me on another hatchcover were Captain Oudouse and the Heathen </s>
<s> They were fighting over the possession of the coverat least the Frenchman was </s>
<s> Paien noir </s>
<s> I heard him scream and at the same time I saw him kick the Kanaka </s>
<s> Now Captain Oudouse had lost all his clothes except his shoes and they were heavy brogans </s>
<s> It was a cruel blow for it caught the Heathen on the mouth and the point of the chin halfstunning him </s>
<s> I looked for him to retaliate but he contented himself with swimming about forlornly a safe ten feet away </s>
<s> Whenever a fling of the sea threw him closer the Frenchman hanging on with his hands kicked out at him with both feet </s>
<s> Also at the moment of delivering each kick he called the Kanaka a black heathen </s>
<s> For two centimes I'd come over there and drown you you white beast </s>
<s> I yelled </s>
<s> The only reason I did not go was that I felt too tired </s>
<s> The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating </s>
<s> So I called to the Kanaka to come to me and proceeded to share the hatchcover with him </s>
<s> Otoo he told me his name was pronounced O'mto'mo'm also he told me that he was a native of Bora Bora the most westerly of the Society Group </s>
<s> As I learned afterward he had got the hatchcover first and after some time encountering Captain Oudouse had offered to share it with him and had been kicked off for his pains </s>
<s> And that was how Otoo and I first came together </s>
<s> He was no fighter </s>
<s> He was all sweetness and gentleness a lovecreature though he stood nearly six feet tall and was muscled like a gladiator </s>
<s> He was no fighter but he was also no coward </s>
<s> He had the heart of a lion and in the years that followed I have seen him run risks that I would never dream of taking </s>
<s> What I mean is that while he was no fighter and while he always avoided precipitating a row he never ran away from trouble when it started </s>
<s> And it was 'Ware shoal </s>
<s> when once Otoo went into action </s>
<s> I shall never forget what he did to Bill King </s>
<s> It occurred in German Samoa </s>
<s> Bill King was hailed the champion heavyweight of the American navy </s>
<s> He was a big brute of a man a veritable gorilla one of those hardhitting roughhousing chaps and clever with his fists as well </s>
<s> He picked the quarrel and he kicked Otoo twice and struck him once before Otoo felt it to be necessary to fight </s>
<s> I don't think it lasted four minutes at the end of which time Bill King was the unhappy possessor of four broken ribs a broken forearm and a dislocated shoulderblade </s>
<s> Otoo knew nothing of scientific boxing </s>
<s> He was merely a manhandler and Bill King was something like three months in recovering from the bit of manhandling he received that afternoon on Apia beach </s>
<s> But I am running ahead of my yarn </s>
<s> We shared the hatchcover between us </s>
<s> We took turn and turn about one lying flat on the cover and resting while the other submerged to the neck merely held on with his hands </s>
<s> For three days and nights spell and spell on the cover and in the water we drifted over the ocean </s>
<s> Toward the last I was delirious most of the time and there were times too when I heard Otoo babbling and raving in his native tongue </s>
<s> Our continuous immersion prevented us from dying of thirst though the sea water and the sunshine gave us the prettiest imaginable combination of salt pickle and sunburn </s>
<s> In the end Otoo saved MY life for I came to lying on the beach twenty feet from the water sheltered from the sun by a couple of cocoanut leaves </s>
<s> No one but Otoo could have dragged me there and stuck up the leaves for shade </s>
<s> He was lying beside me </s>
<s> I went off again and the next time I came around it was cool and starry night and Otoo was pressing a drinking cocoanut to my lips </s>
<s> We were the sole survivors of the Petite Jeanne </s>
<s> Captain Oudouse must have succumbed to exhaustion for several days later his hatchcover drifted ashore without him </s>
<s> Otoo and I lived with the natives of the atoll for a week when we were rescued by a French cruiser and taken to Tahiti </s>
<s> In the meantime however we had performed the ceremony of exchanging names </s>
<s> In the South Seas such a ceremony binds two men closer together than bloodbrothership </s>
<s> The initiative had been mine and Otoo was rapturously delighted when I suggested it </s>
<s> It is well he said in Tahitian </s>
<s> For we have been mates together for three days on the lips of Death </s>
<s> But Death stuttered I smiled </s>
<s> It was a brave deed you did master he replied and Death was not vile enough to speak </s>
<s> Why do you `master' me </s>
<s> I demanded with a show of hurt feelings </s>
<s> We have exchanged names </s>
<s> To you I am Otoo </s>
<s> To me you are Charley </s>
<s> And between you and me forever and forever you shall be Charley and I shall be Otoo </s>
<s> It is the way of the custom </s>
<s> And when we die if it does happen that we live again somewhere beyond the stars and the sky still shall you be Charley to me and I Otoo to you </s>
<s> Yes master he answered his eyes luminous and soft with joy </s>
<s> There you go </s>
<s> I cried indignantly </s>
<s> What does it matter what my lips utter </s>
<s> he argued </s>
<s> They are only my lips </s>
<s> But I shall think OTOO always </s>
<s> Whenever I think of myself I shall think of you </s>
<s> Whenever men call me by name I shall think of you </s>
<s> And beyond the sky and beyond the stars always and forever you shall be Otoo to me </s>
<s> Is it well master </s>
<s> I hid my smile and answered that it was well </s>
<s> We parted at Papeete </s>
<s> I remained ashore to recuperate and he went on in a cutter to his own island Bora Bora </s>
<s> Six weeks later he was back </s>
<s> I was surprised for he had told me of his wife and said that he was returning to her and would give over sailing on far voyages </s>
<s> Where do you go master </s>
<s> he asked after our first greetings </s>
<s> I shrugged my shoulders </s>
<s> It was a hard question </s>
<s> To all the world was my answer </s>
<s> All the world all the sea and all the islands that are in the sea </s>
<s> I will go with you he said simply </s>
<s> My wife is dead </s>
<s> I never had a brother but from what I have seen of other men's brothers I doubt if any man ever had one who was to him what Otoo was to me </s>
<s> He was brother and father and mother as well </s>
<s> And this I knowI lived a straighter and a better man because of Otoo </s>
<s> I had to live straight in Otoo's eyes </s>
<s> Because of him I dared not tarnish myself </s>
<s> He made me his ideal compounding me I fear chiefly out of his own love and worship and there were times when I stood close to the steep pitch of hell and would have taken the plunge had not the thought of Otoo restrained me </s>
<s> His pride in me entered into me until it became one of the major rules in my personal code to do nothing that would diminish that pride of his </s>
<s> Naturally I did not learn right away what his feelings were toward me </s>
<s> He never criticised never censured and slowly the exalted place I held in his eyes dawned upon me and slowly I grew to comprehend the hurt I could inflict upon him by being anything less than my best </s>
<s> For seventeen years we were together </s>
<s> For seventeen years he was at my shoulder watching while I slept nursing me through fever and wounds aye and receiving wounds in fighting for me </s>
<s> He signed on the same ships with me and together we ranged the Pacific from Hawaii to Sydney Head and from Torres Strait to the Galapagos </s>
<s> We blackbirded from the New hebrides and the Line Islands over to the westward clear through the Louisiades New Britain New Ireland and New Hanover </s>
<s> We were wrecked three timesin the Gilberts in the Santa Cruz group and in the Fijis </s>
<s> And we traded and salved wherever a dollar promised in the way of pearl and pearl shell copra beche de mer hawkbill turtle shell and stranded wrecks </s>
<s> It began in Papeete immediately after his announcement that he was going with me over all the sea and the islands in the midst thereof </s>
<s> There was a club in those days in Papeete where the pearlers traders captains and South Sea adventurers foregathered </s>
<s> The play ran high and the drink ran high and I am very much afraid that I kept later hours than were becoming or proper </s>
<s> No matter what the hour was when I left the club there was Otoo waiting to see me safely home </s>
<s> At first I smiled </s>
<s> Next I chided him </s>
<s> Then I told him flatly I stood in need of no wetnursing </s>
<s> After that I did not see him when I came out of the club </s>
<s> Quite by accident a week or so later I discovered that he still saw me home lurking across the street among the shadows of the mango trees </s>
<s> What could I do </s>
<s> I know what I did do </s>
<s> Insensibly I began to keep better hours </s>
<s> On wet and stormy nights in the thick of the folly and the fun the thought would come to me of Otoo keeping his dreary vigil under the dripping mangoes </s>
<s> Truly he made me a better man </s>
<s> Yet he was not straitlaced </s>
<s> And he knew nothing of common Christian morality </s>
<s> All the people on Bora Bora were Christians </s>
<s> But he was a heathen the only unbeliever on the island a gross materialist who believed that when he died he was dead </s>
<s> He believed merely in fair play and squaredealing </s>
<s> Petty meanness in his code was almost as serious as wanton homicide and I am sure that he respected a murderer more than a man given to small practices </s>
<s> Concerning me personally he objected to my doing anything that was hurtful to me </s>
<s> Gambling was all right </s>
<s> He was an ardent gambler himself </s>
<s> But late hours he explained were bad for one's health </s>
<s> He had seen men who did not take care of themselves die of fever </s>
<s> He was no teetotaler and welcomed a stiff nip any time when it was wet work in the boats </s>
<s> On the other hand he believed in liquor in moderation </s>
<s> He had seen many men killed or disgraced by squareface or Scotch </s>
<s> Otoo had my welfare always at heart </s>
<s> He thought ahead for me weighed my plans and took a greater interest in them than I did myself </s>
<s> At first when I was unaware of this interest of his in my affairs he had to divine my intentions as for instance at Papeete when I contemplated going partners with a knavish fellow countryman on a guano venture </s>
<s> I did not know he was a knave </s>
<s> Nor did any white man in Papeete </s>
<s> Neither did Otoo know but he saw how thick we were getting and found out for me and that without my asking </s>
<s> Native sailors from the ends of the seas knock about on the beach in Tahiti and Otoo suspicious merely went among them till he had gathered sufficient data to justify his suspicions </s>
<s> Oh it was a nice history that of Randolph Waters </s>
<s> I couldn't believe it when Otoo first narrated it but when I sheeted it home to Waters he gave in without a murmur and got away on the first steamer to Auckland </s>
<s> At first I am free to confess I resented Otoo's poking his nose into my business </s>
<s> But I knew that he was wholly unselfish and soon I had to acknowledge his wisdom and discretion </s>
<s> He had his eyes open always to my main chance and he was both keensighted and farsighted </s>
<s> In time he became my counselor until he knew more of my business than I did myself </s>
<s> He really had my interest at heart more than I did </s>
<s> Mine was the magnificent carelessness of youth for I preferred romance to dollars and adventure to a comfortable billet with all night in </s>
<s> So it was well that I had some one to look out for me </s>
<s> I know that if it had not been for Otoo I should not be here today </s>
<s> Of numerous instances let me give one </s>
<s> I had had some experience in blackbirding before I went pearling in the Paumotus </s>
<s> Otoo and I were on the beach in Samoawe really were on the beach and hard agroundwhen my chance came to go as a recruiter on a blackbird brig </s>
<s> Otoo signed on before the mast and for the next halfdozen years in as many ships we knocked about the wildest portions of Melanesia </s>
<s> Otoo saw to it that he always pulled strokeoar in my boat </s>
<s> Our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the beach </s>
<s> The covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off shore while the recruiter's boat also lying on its oars kept afloat on the edge of the beach </s>
<s> When I landed with my trade goods leaving my steering sweep apeak Otoo left his stroke position and came into the stern sheets where a Winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas </s>
<s> The boat's crew was also armed the Sniders concealed under canvas flaps that ran the length of the gunwales </s>
<s> While I was busy arguing and persuading the woollyheaded cannibals to come and labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept watch </s>
<s> And often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery </s>
<s> Sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle knocking a nigger over that was the first warning I received </s>
<s> And in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard </s>
<s> Once I remember on Santa Anna the boat grounded just as the trouble began </s>
<s> The covering boat was dashing to our assistance but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it arrived </s>
<s> Otoo took a flying leap ashore dug both hands into the trade goods and scattered tobacco beads tomahawks knives and calicoes in all directions </s>
<s> This was too much for the woolly heads </s>
<s> While they scrambled for the treasures the boat was shoved clear and we were aboard and forty feet away </s>
<s> And I got thirty recruits off that very beach in the next four hours </s>
<s> The particular instance I have in mind was on Malaita the most savage island in the easterly Solomons </s>
<s> The natives had been remarkably friendly and how were we to know that the whole village had been taking up a collection for over two years with which to buy a white man's head </s>
<s> The beggars are all headhunters and they especially esteem that of a white man </s>
<s> The fellow who captured the head would receive the whole collection </s>
<s> As I say they appeared very friendly and this day I was fully a hundred yards down the beach from the boat </s>
<s> Otoo had cautioned me and as usual when I did not heed him I came to grief </s>
<s> The first thing I knew a cloud of spears sailed out of the mangrove swamp at me </s>
<s> At least a dozen were sticking into me </s>
<s> I started to run but tripped over one that was fast in my calf and went down </s>
<s> The woolly heads made a run for me each with a longhandled fantail tomahawk with which to hack off my head </s>
<s> They were so eager for the prize that they got in one another's way </s>
<s> In the confusion I avoided several hacks by throwing myself right and left on the sand </s>
<s> Then Otoo arrivedOtoo the manhandler </s>
<s> In some way he had got hold of a heavy warclub and at close quarters it was a far more efficient weapon than a rifle </s>
<s> He was right in the thick of them so that they could not spear him while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless </s>
<s> He was fighting for me and he was in a true Berserker rage </s>
<s> The way he handled that club was amazing </s>
<s> Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges </s>
<s> It was not until he had driven them back picked me up in his arms and started to run that he received his first wounds </s>
<s> He arrived in the boat with four spearthrusts got his Winchester and with it got a man for every shot </s>
<s> Then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up </s>
<s> Seventeen years we were together </s>
<s> He made me </s>
<s> I should today be a supercargo a recruiter or a memory if it had not been for him </s>
<s> You spend your money and you go out and get more he said one day </s>
<s> It is easy to get money now </s>
<s> But when you get old your money will be spent and you will not be able to go out and get more </s>
<s> I know master </s>
<s> I have studied the way of white men </s>
<s> On the beaches are many old men who were young once and who could get money just like you </s>
<s> Now they are old and they have nothing and they wait about for the young men like you to come ashore and buy drinks for them </s>
<s> The black boy is a slave on the plantations </s>
<s> He gets twenty dollars a year </s>
<s> He works hard </s>
<s> The overseer does not work hard </s>
<s> He rides a horse and watches the black boy work </s>
<s> He gets twelve hundred dollars a year </s>
<s> I am a sailor on the schooner </s>
<s> I get fifteen dollars a month </s>
<s> That is because I am a good sailor </s>
<s> I work hard </s>
<s> The captain has a double awning and drinks beer out of long bottles </s>
<s> I have never seen him haul a rope or pull an oar </s>
<s> He gets one hundred and fifty dollars a month </s>
<s> I am a sailor </s>
<s> He is a navigator </s>
<s> Master I think it would be very good for you to know navigation </s>
<s> Otoo spurred me on to it </s>
<s> He sailed with me as second mate on my first schooner and he was far prouder of my command than was I myself </s>
<s> Later on it was The captain is well paid master but the ship is in his keeping and he is never free from the burden </s>
<s> It is the owner who is better paid the owner who sits ashore with many servants and turns his money over </s>
<s> True but a schooner costs five thousand dollarsan old schooner at that I objected </s>
<s> I should be an old man before I saved five thousand dollars </s>
<s> There be short ways for white men to make money he went on pointing ashore at the cocoanutfringed beach </s>
<s> We were in the Solomons at the time picking up a cargo of ivorynuts along the east coast of Guadalcanar </s>
<s> Between this river mouth and the next it is two miles he said </s>
<s> The flat land runs far back </s>
<s> It is worth nothing now </s>
<s> Next yearwho knows!or the year aftermen will pay much money for that land </s>
<s> The anchorage is good </s>
<s> Big steamers can lie close up </s>
<s> You can buy the land four miles deep from the old chief for ten thousand sticks of tobacco ten bottles of squareface and a Snider which will cost you maybe one hundred dollars </s>
<s> Then you place the deed with the commissioner and the next year or the year after you sell and become the owner of a ship </s>
<s> I followed his lead and his words came true though in three years instead of two </s>
<s> Next came the grasslands deal on Guadalcanartwenty thousand acres on a governmental nine hundred and ninetynine years' lease at a nominal sum </s>
<s> I owned the lease for precisely ninety days when I sold it to the Moonlight Soap crowd for half a fortune </s>
<s> Always it was Otoo who looked ahead and saw the opportunity </s>
<s> He was responsible for the salving of the Doncasterbought in at auction for five hundred dollars and clearing fifteen thousand after every expense was paid </s>
<s> He led me into the Savaii plantation and the cocoa venture on Upolu </s>
<s> We did not go seafaring so much as in the old days now </s>
<s> I was too well off </s>
<s> I married and my standard of living rose but Otoo remained the same oldtime Otoo moving about the house or trailing through the office his wooden pipe in his mouth a shilling undershirt on his back and a fourshilling lavalava about his loins </s>
<s> I could not get him to spend money </s>
<s> There was no way of repaying him except with love and God knows he got that in full measure from all of us </s>
<s> The children worshiped him and if he had been spoilable my wife would surely have been his undoing </s>
<s> The children </s>
<s> He really was the one who showed them the way of their feet in the world practical </s>
<s> He began by teaching them to walk </s>
<s> He sat up with them when they were sick </s>
<s> One by one when they were scarcely toddlers he took them down to the lagoon and made them into amphibians </s>
<s> He taught them more than I ever knew of the habits of fish and the ways of catching them </s>
<s> In the bush it was the same thing </s>
<s> At seven Tom knew more woodcraft than I ever dreamed existed </s>
<s> At six Mary went over the Sliding Rock without a quiverand I have seen strong men balk at that feat </s>
<s> And when Frank had just turned six he could bring up shillings from the bottom in three fathoms </s>
<s> My people in Bora Bora do not like heathen they are all Christians and I do not like Bora Bora Christians he said one day when I with the idea of getting him to spend some of the money that was rightfully his had been trying to persuade him to make a visit to his own island in one of our schoonersa special voyage that I had hoped to make a recordbreaker in the matter of prodigal expense </s>
<s> I say one of OUR schooners though legally at the time they belonged to me </s>
<s> I struggled long with him to enter into partnership </s>
<s> We have been partners from the day the Petite Jeanne went down he said at last </s>
<s> But if your heart so wishes then shall we become partners by the law </s>
<s> I have no work to do yet are my expenses large </s>
<s> I drink and eat and smoke in plentyit costs much I know </s>
<s> I do not pay for the playing of billiards for I play on your table but still the money goes </s>
<s> Fishing on the reef is only a rich man's pleasure </s>
<s> It is shocking the cost of hooks and cotton line </s>
<s> Yes it is necessary that we be partners by the law </s>
<s> I need the money </s>
<s> I shall get it from the head clerk in the office </s>
<s> So the papers were made out and recorded </s>
<s> A year later I was compelled to complain </s>
<s> Charley said I you are a wicked old fraud a miserly skinflint a miserable landcrab </s>
<s> Behold your share for the year in all our partnership has been thousands of dollars </s>
<s> The head clerk has given me this paper </s>
<s> It says that during the year you have drawn just eightyseven dollars and twenty cents </s>
<s> Is there any owing me </s>
<s> he asked anxiously </s>
<s> I tell you thousands and thousands I answered </s>
<s> His face brightened as with an immense relief </s>
<s> It is well he said </s>
<s> See that the headclerk keeps good account of it </s>
<s> When I want it I shall want it and there must not be a cent missing </s>
<s> If there is he added fiercely after a pause it must come out of the clerk's wages </s>
<s> And all the time as I afterward learned his will drawn up by Carruthers and making me sole beneficiary lay in the American consul's safe </s>
<s> But the end came as the end must come to all human associations </s>
<s> It occurred in the Solomons where our wildest work had been done in the wild young days and where we were once moreprincipally on a holiday incidentally to look after our holdings on Florida Island and to look over the pearling possibilities of the Mboli Pass </s>
<s> We were lying at Savo having run in to trade for curios </s>
<s> Now Savo is alive with sharks </s>
<s> The custom of the woolly heads of burying their dead in the sea did not tend to discourage the sharks from making the adjacent waters a hangout </s>
<s> It was my luck to be coming aboard in a tiny overloaded native canoe when the thing capsized </s>
<s> There were four woolly heads and myself in it or rather hanging to it </s>
<s> The schooner was a hundred yards away </s>
<s> I was just hailing for a boat when one of the woolly heads began to scream </s>
<s> Holding on to the end of the canoe both he and that portion of the canoe were dragged under several times </s>
<s> Then he loosed his clutch and disappeared </s>
<s> A shark had got him </s>
<s> The three remaining niggers tried to climb out of the water upon the bottom of the canoe </s>
<s> I yelled and cursed and struck at the nearest with my fist but it was no use </s>
<s> They were in a blind funk </s>
<s> The canoe could barely have supported one of them </s>
<s> Under the three it upended and rolled sidewise throwing them back into the water </s>
<s> I abandoned the canoe and started to swim toward the schooner expecting to be picked up by the boat before I got there </s>
<s> One of the niggers elected to come with me and we swam along silently side by side now and again putting our faces into the water and peering about for sharks </s>
<s> The screams of the men who stayed by the canoe informed us that they were taken </s>
<s> I was peering into the water when I saw a big shark pass directly beneath me </s>
<s> He was fully sixteen feet in length </s>
<s> I saw the whole thing </s>
<s> He got the woolly head by the middle and away he went the poor devil head shoulders and arms out of water all the time screeching in a heartrending way </s>
<s> He was carried along in this fashion for several hundred feet when he was dragged beneath the surface </s>
<s> I swam doggedly on hoping that that was the last unattached shark </s>
<s> But there was another </s>
<s> Whether it was one that had attacked the natives earlier or whether it was one that had made a good meal elsewhere I do not know </s>
<s> At any rate he was not in such haste as the others </s>
<s> I could not swim so rapidly now for a large part of my effort was devoted to keeping track of him </s>
<s> I was watching him when he made his first attack </s>
<s> By good luck I got both hands on his nose and though his momentum nearly shoved me under I managed to keep him off </s>
<s> He veered clear and began circling about again </s>
<s> A second time I escaped him by the same maneuver </s>
<s> The third rush was a miss on both sides </s>
<s> He sheered at the moment my hands should have landed on his nose but his sandpaper hideI had on a sleeveless undershirtscraped the skin off one arm from elbow to shoulder </s>
<s> By this time I was played out and gave up hope </s>
<s> The schooner was still two hundred feet away </s>
<s> My face was in the water and I was watching him maneuver for another attempt when I saw a brown body pass between us </s>
<s> It was Otoo </s>
<s> Swim for the schooner master he said and he spoke gayly as though the affair was a mere lark </s>
<s> I know sharks </s>
<s> The shark is my brother </s>
<s> I obeyed swimming slowly on while Otoo swam about me keeping always between me and the shark foiling his rushes and encouraging me </s>
<s> The davittackle carried away and they are rigging the falls he explained a minute or so later and then went under to head off another attack </s>
<s> By the time the schooner was thirty feet away I was about done for </s>
<s> I could scarcely move </s>
<s> They were heaving lines at us from on board but these continually fell short </s>
<s> The shark finding that it was receiving no hurt had become bolder </s>
<s> Several times it nearly got me but each time Otoo was there just the moment before it was too late </s>
<s> Of course Otoo could have saved himself any time </s>
<s> But he stuck by me </s>
<s> Good by Charley I'm finished I just managed to gasp </s>
<s> I knew that the end had come and that the next moment I should throw up my hands and go down </s>
<s> But Otoo laughed in my face saying I will show you a new trick </s>
<s> I will make that shark damn sick </s>
<s> He dropped in behind me where the shark was preparing to come at me </s>
<s> A little more to the left he next called out </s>
<s> There is a line there on the water </s>
<s> To the left master to the left </s>
<s> I changed my course and struck out blindly </s>
<s> I was by that time barely conscious </s>
<s> As my hand closed on the line I heard an exclamation from on board </s>
<s> I turned and looked </s>
<s> There was no sign of Otoo </s>
<s> The next instant he broke surface </s>
<s> Both hands were off at the wrist the stumps spouting blood </s>
<s> Otoo he called softly and I could see in his gaze the love that thrilled in his voice </s>
<s> Then and then only at the very last of all our years he called me by that name </s>
<s> Good by Otoo he called </s>
<s> Then he was dragged under and I was hauled aboard where I fainted in the captain's arms </s>
<s> And so passed Otoo who saved me and made me a man and who saved me in the end </s>
<s> We met in the maw of a hurricane and parted in the maw of a shark with seventeen intervening years of comradeship the like of which I dare to assert have never befallen two men the one brown and the other white </s>
<s> If Jehovah be from his high place watching every sparrow fall not least in His Kingdom shall be Otoo the one heathen of Bora Bora </s>
<s> And if there be no place for him in that Kingdom then will I have none of it </s>
<s> Vol. XXIII No.2 AUGUST 1910 THE QUESTION HOW </s>
<s> page 205208 By WILLIAM HANNA THOMSON M.D </s>
<s> LL.D </s>
<s> Author of Brain and Personality What is Physical Life </s>
<s> etc </s>
<s> Physician to the Roosevelt Hospital Consulting Physician to the New York State Manhattan Hospital for the Insane formerly Professor of the Practice of Medicine and Diseases of the Nervous System New York University Medical College ExPresident of the New York Academy of Medicine etc </s>
<s> IN one of Carlyle's earliest productions dealing with the philosophy of Clothes he showed that a man quite plainly reveals his inner self by what he wears </s>
<s> So we would now discuss what the being Man reveals about himself by his eternal question How </s>
<s> As language is a lofty endowment and moreover on this earth exclusively human we would lead up to the subject by stating what the parts of speech are </s>
<s> According to the Arabs who surpass all other peoples in the study of languagefor they claim that they have twentyfive thousand books on grammar in their literaturethe parts of speech are three and as one of their old scholars states this threefold division of speech is not confined to one language but is universal because human speech does not differ with the difference of human tongues </s>
<s> These three parts are first nounsthe names of things second verbsthe names of events and third the partitivesor the words which express the relations of things to events </s>
<s> Thus the most abstract of verbs to be refers to an event for when a man says I am he is mentioning an event in the history of the universe which did not occur till he existed </s>
<s> This division however necessitates that the adjectives should be regarded as nouns and so they are classed in all Semitic languages as the Hebrew the Arabic the Syriac etc </s>
<s> The writers of the New Testament therefore could not write Greek without continually falling into their native Hebrew idiom so that if the passages were translated literally some modern expositions would have to be much modified </s>
<s> Thus Who created the worlds by the word of his power means Who created the worlds by his powerful word </s>
<s> The body of our humiliation is our humiliating body </s>
<s> Who shall deliver me from the body of this death </s>
<s> is from this deadly body as the context of the passage clearly shows </s>
<s> In each case the second noun is the adjective modifying the first </s>
<s> Moreover the most interesting deduction from this division of the parts of speech is that the partitives are far the highest in rank among words because they express pure relations which only the royal mind of man can so distinctly perceive as to make words for them </s>
<s> Thus a dog can learn his own name and understand the verbs go and come especially with the imperative tone of his master but he could never understand the words outgoing year or incoming year </s>
<s> Prepositions belong to the partitives and with different prepositions attached to one and the same thing or noun the human mind can step through the vast regions of thought as easily as the ether can vibrate through space </s>
<s> Thus the Latin scriptio the name of a thing a writing gives us the following changes according to the preposition An Ascription is not a CONscription by any means nor does a conscription mean anything like a DEScription nor is that the same thing with an INscription nor when we PREscribe for a man are we PROscribing him and every one of us knows when the agent of a worthy cause enters what the difference is between a SUBscription and a SUPERscription </s>
<s> To the adverbs however must be given the preeminence among all human words </s>
<s> But even here there are gradations in rank </s>
<s> Thus the adverb Why </s>
<s> may be nothing but a question of curiosity and hence its idea may be suggested to an inquisitive monkey </s>
<s> But it is not so with the question How </s>
<s> Why </s>
<s> may be answered by an affirmation but How </s>
<s> can be answered only by a demonstration </s>
<s> Now as our object is to call speech to witness as to what is in man or in other words what man is himself we will proceed to analyze the testimony of this word How </s>
<s> HOW FINDS A PLANET First It does not refer to anything which appears on the surface </s>
<s> Instead it seeks to find the hidden and the unknown by following up one clue after another </s>
<s> When the astronomer Leverrier found that the planets Saturn and Uranus did not come to time he asked himself how that could be </s>
<s> Meanwhile the answer to any number of hows must have been previously demonstrated by him and by other astronomers before the movements of these great and distant heavenly bodies could be shown as not according to the clocklike regularity of planets in their courses </s>
<s> He reasoned that only one probable how could account for the facts namely another planet of just such a size and weight and moving at just such a distance would suffice thus to hold back Saturn and Uranus in their orbits </s>
<s> And so he calculated how large this heavenly body was how heavy it was and then just where it was until by this human but sure detective system astronomers caught sight of Neptuneafter Leverrier told them where to look for it </s>
<s> But after all to decide how the vast heavenly bodies move in space is easy compared with finding out how to make a sewing machine go </s>
<s> For a needle to thread itself and then rapidly proceed to sew without the help of fingers calls for the discovery of more hows than are needed to explain Laplace's Mecanique celeste </s>
<s> Mass and gravity suffice for the one but only a Yankee's mind could have created the other </s>
<s> We have now come to a great wordcreate </s>
<s> A creator is a being who gives origin to things which would not exist but for his intelligent purpose and design </s>
<s> Now man has simply filled this earth with his own creations all due to himself alone and to none other and all again by pondering the question How </s>
<s> He began for instance by putting a hole through a flint hatchet and ended with putting a hole through the Alps </s>
<s> In this last an engineer stood at the foot of the great mountain and asked himself how he could tunnel it for nations to pass through </s>
<s> He saw a small stream dashing down the mountainside and at once found his desired how for he made that stream work big drills by compressed air till the everlasting rocks themselves had to give in </s>
<s> But man is an infinite creatorby which we mean that his creative capacity is limitless and inexhaustible </s>
<s> No sooner does he create one thing than he turns to create another thing totally different from it </s>
<s> A locomotive thundering past with a long train has no resemblance to a telegraph line nor that in turn to a great printing press </s>
<s> Man coolly sets at defiance the most fundamental laws of physical science </s>
<s> Thus a heavy load of passengers sitting in no less heavy cars if put on a smooth inclined plane must slide down faster and faster to the bottom or Vulcan would be confounded </s>
<s> But man strings a thin wire overhead which would snap instantly if the load gave it one pull but something which some how man causes to pass along that wire makes the trolley with its live freight go uphill faster than a horse can run </s>
<s> THE ETHER ENSLAVED And what about that mysterious ether </s>
<s> It can neither be seen heard felt handled smelt nor tasted </s>
<s> Nevertheless man has learned so much about its how that he is turning it into as menial a servant obedient to his wishes as he has made of electricity the cause of sublime thunder for man bids the ether carry his stock quotations or any other message of his to the ends of the earth </s>
<s> These are great doings but really no greater than his small doings for the least of these is just as impossible for other earthly creatures as are an Alpine tunnel or a battleship </s>
<s> A large convention of chimpanzees could not combine to make one pin or one sleevebutton if they tried </s>
<s> All this is because man is native to the world of relations which no other earthly beings are because they cannot go beyond the information provided by their bodily senses </s>
<s> Man on the contrary gains infinitely more knowledge than his bodily senses can afford </s>
<s> By studying the relations of abstract points to abstract lines he becomes a mathematician </s>
<s> Following up the many hows of chemistry he talks about molecules atoms and ions as fluently as if he had seen or handled them </s>
<s> MAN IS INVISIBLE This explains how man can and does create </s>
<s> Every great invention existed first in the mind of the inventor </s>
<s> So the great engineer who made the Brooklyn Bridge never had to handle one of the materials used in its construction for every stone wire and bolt was provided for in that engineer's mind before any part of that tremendous mass of matter could be seen on the earth </s>
<s> Moreover this great human creator is as invisible as the Divine Creator Himself </s>
<s> People are continually saying that they will not believe in a thing till they can see it thus pinning their faith to the testimony of that one of our senses which makes more mistakes than do all our other senses put together </s>
<s> When a man six feet high is a mile off it says that he is only six inches high </s>
<s> The eye can see nothing of the vast microscopic living world which lies within six inches of the eyeball and so we have had to invent a microscope to make up for this serious deficiency </s>
<s> But what would the Russian Witte not have given if he could have telegraphed to St. Petersburg that he had actually SEEN the Japanese Komura while they were talking about making peace at Portsmouth New Hampshire and that he knew just what the courteous Jap thought and proposed </s>
<s> All that he saw was the Asiatic's smiling face and other things of his outside </s>
<s> Every human personality belongs to the real world the world of the Unseen and cannot be known except as he chooses to reveal himself </s>
<s> BRAIN NOT THE MAN Some persons might object here that the brain is both visible and tangible in man and that man is in his brain and therefore the brain is man </s>
<s> Medical science however shows that the brain no more thinks than the hand and foot do but is simply the instrument of the invisible thinker </s>
<s> The proof of this is that we have two brains just as we have two eyes and two ears but that only one of our two brain hemispheres is the instrument for talking thinking or knowing </s>
<s> Which one of the two hemispheres will be the mental one will depend altogether on how it has been TAUGHT by the invisible thinker who will begin to teach the left hemisphere if he is righthanded or the right hemisphere if he is lefthanded </s>
<s> He will leave the other hemisphere in each case wholly speechless or thoughtless and concerned only with the business of governing the muscles or receiving the bodily sensations of its corresponding side </s>
<s> If brain matter really itself thought we should have two thinking and speaking hemispheresand this the first case of loss of speech by an apoplectic clot would disprove </s>
<s> By thy words thou shalt be judged </s>
<s> This means that man is to be judged by his own creations for it is only men who create words </s>
<s> By their words they show what is in them both intellectually and morally </s>
<s> We have demonstrated that the being who can ask the question How </s>
<s> naturally belongs to the universe </s>
<s> Already he knows what stuff inconceivably distant stars are made of and the how to know that he found in a small glass prism </s>
<s> THE MORAL HOW It would seem therefore as if it were by some temporary accident that he is held to this little material speck of matter called the earth </s>
<s> And this impression grows upon us as we study the greatest facts of human life </s>
<s> We enter this world knowing nothing and not nearly so well equipped to take care of ourselves as are other animals </s>
<s> There is no helplessness like that of a babe </s>
<s> But wonderfully early he begins to ask the question How </s>
<s> A little boy will ask more questions in a day than his father will ask in a week nor can he be stopped or deceived because the question Why </s>
<s> you can answer as you please but not How </s>
<s> He who can ask How </s>
<s> can be a learner as long as he exists whether here or hereafter </s>
<s> In his life here he may become either a great financier or a great statesman but certainly not either unless he knows how </s>
<s> Any education in fact is simply learning how </s>
<s> What is true in the intellectual world is still more true in the moral world </s>
<s> Whenever a question bearing on morals enters every one should stop and ask How </s>
<s> A mistake here is like entering the wrong gate in a large railroad station </s>
<s> The longer you stay in its corresponding train the farther it will take you from where you should go </s>
<s> For example there are some who say that the human will is not free but that our actions are all in the last analysis according to our makeup </s>
<s> In other words we are machines which must go as they are made to go </s>
<s> There is therefore no right nor wrong in human conduct for machines cannot be held responsible for conduct or the way they gothere can be no sinful automobile or wicked windmill </s>
<s> According to these reasoners therefore when human law punishes one who has robbed a widow of all she had or has seduced the daughter of a friend or committed a coldblooded murder the law is wholly illogical in punishing him because since he is a machine his punishment is like throwing a clock out of a window if it does not keep good time </s>
<s> The only answer to such a talker should be Get out </s>
<s> with particular emphasis on the out </s>

<s> Vol. XXIII No.2 AUGUST 1910 INSTEAD OF AN ARTICLE page 209214 About Pittsburg and Incidentally about Editing a Magazine Important articles in magazines of the type of COLLIER'S MCCLURE'S the AMERICAN and EVERYBODY'S like plays are rewritten rather than written </s>
<s> Too begin with there must be the idea then to find the man or woman best able to embody it </s>
<s> That settled the author must steep himself in his subject </s>
<s> When he acquires mastery his findings are written down and submitted to the editor </s>
<s> This may take months it often requires years </s>
<s> It has happened that the editor did not know what he wanted until he read this first draft </s>
<s> Now he has the subject spread before him by an authority </s>
<s> His associates all read it and criticise </s>
<s> Sometimes that first draft is flawless but most often it is returned to the author with direction for reconstruction </s>
<s> The process may be repeated half a dozen times </s>
<s> Finally the manuscript is satisfactory which means that it is valuable simply expressed and readable </s>
<s> It is in shape for publication </s>
<s> It is put into type and sent around to outside experts who are the representative authorities on the subject </s>
<s> In these days a magazine can afford to have its conclusions disputed but its facts must be incontrovertible </s>
<s> Perhaps the trouble the big publications take to be rightand that means square and just as well as accurateexplains such prestige and influence as they now enjoy in America </s>
<s> At a women's club gathering in Mississippi recently Harris Dickson told his audience something about an article of his that had recently appeared in EVERYBODY'S </s>
<s> He explained that a manuscript written by another man had been sent him to put in shape </s>
<s> The facts were there and the moral but the treatment was technical </s>
<s> It lacked carrying power </s>
<s> Dickson knew nothing of the other author and so proceeded to get up the subject at first hand </s>
<s> He took not one of the facts for granted </s>
<s> After three months he returned the revised manuscript to the magazine </s>
<s> It was sent back with specific directions for rewriting </s>
<s> In due course he again remailed it to the editor who congratulated him on his achievementfor that is what it was </s>
<s> Then the article having attained a satisfactory form it was on Fraternal Insurance was sent round among the experts </s>
<s> The first man who read it was a high official of one of the old line insurance companies but a hearty believer in the fraternal system </s>
<s> He returned it with approval and an elaborate criticism </s>
<s> Then it was submitted to the chief insurance commissioner of a western statethe undoubted political authority on the subject </s>
<s> The approval and criticisms of both men with the manuscript were again forwarded to Mr. Dickson </s>
<s> The necessary corrections having been incorporated the manuscript was ready for the printer </s>
<s> To make assurance doubly sure proofs were sent out to prominent officials of leading fraternal organizations who returned them with most commendatory letters </s>
<s> And then and only then did it appear in the magazine </s>
<s> Mr. Dickson's audience doubtless under the impression that magazines are produced by editors out of the contributions sent them by mail expressed surprise that so much time effort and money should be devoted to what seemed a comparatively unimportant subject </s>
<s> Yet it involved a matter that concerned five million men and their families and a tremendous controversy </s>
<s> Its appearance has made the controversy even keener and of course the enemies of sanity and good order in fraternalism are now hurling bolts at us </s>
<s> However when we have done our part and know we are right we stay put </s>
<s> Mr. Dickson told part of what to us is a familiar story </s>
<s> In this instance he knew nothing of the time and trouble the author and ourselves had taken just to get together the facts and place them in the right perspective </s>
<s> We began on this particular article in November 1906 and during the interval it was being worked at or over by one of some dozen men </s>
<s> The same is true of most of our big series </s>
<s> The Woman's Invasion represented two and a half years of work </s>
<s> Fifteen months elapsed between the delivery of Judge Lindsey's first manuscript and the beginning of publication in the magazine </s>
<s> Trained writers the best men we know about are out investigating and gathering the facts for the articles we will print a year hence </s>
<s> This is the process of magazine making today </s>
<s> It is not peculiar to EVERYBODY'S it is the rule with COLLIER'S MCCLURE'S the AMERICAN and SUCCESS </s>
<s> INSTEAD OF AN ARTICLE This is all by way of introduction to the story of an article that was not written </s>
<s> About the time the Pittsburg flareup began to show itself in the papers it occurred to us that some exposition of the situation there would be of value and interest to our readers </s>
<s> Before going about it we debated it very carefully </s>
<s> Some of us in the office and this magazine is edited by all of us were fairly familiar with the subject and we believed it would subserve no useful purpose to tackle it along the Shame of the Cities lines </s>
<s> We agreed that the way to approach Pittsburg was to consider what had happened there not as a sporadic outburst but as an economic symptom </s>
<s> Whom could we get that was far enough from the controversies involved to treat the subject objectively and with a big perspective </s>
<s> Brand Whitlock </s>
<s> The Mayor of Toledo knows more about cities and their governments and the evils that arise within them than any other man and he can writewith knowledge with sympathy with clarity </s>
<s> Also he knew Pittsburg </s>
<s> So we telegraphed to find if he was free to write an article and when he replied in the affirmative the following letter was sent him April 1 1910 </s>
<s> DEAR MR. WHITLOCK The article we want is on Pittsburg </s>
<s> It is neither our purpose nor our desire merely to muckrake Pittsburg or any other city </s>
<s> The eruption there is typical of similar conditions in other great civic centers throughout the country and it seems to us it might be made the text of a diagnosis of the whole municipal problem in America </s>
<s> Here are a few thoughts that occur to me which might be represented We have come to realize that the real trouble in our country is Privilege </s>
<s> Big business in its ruthless pursuit of results has the ultimate responsibility for the ills that confront us in political social and commercial life </s>
<s> The graft scandals the bank defalcations etc </s>
<s> are simply symptoms of internal disorders </s>
<s> They are the eruptions of the disease </s>
<s> Pittsburg might be called the typical getrichquick community </s>
<s> Its great wealth is based on the abundant coal and iron with which the Creator loaded its environment </s>
<s> Down on those deposits fasten thousands of Americans seized with the mania of moneymaking </s>
<s> They coin the coal and iron into millions </s>
<s> They work feverishly they work their men furiously </s>
<s> It's a mad frenzied scramble for success and sensation </s>
<s> To get rich quicker they exact excessive protection from Congressfirst to prop up infant industries then to consolidate abnormal profits </s>
<s> If the government undertakes to deny their demands they bluster first then intrigue then intimidate </s>
<s> Mills are closed down the prosperity of the country is threatened lobbies are organized corruption funds subscribed until Congress succumbs and new jokers are written into steel tariffs </s>
<s> In the meantime a huge city is upreared </s>
<s> But this city is run for the benefit of its industries not for the comfort of its inhabitants </s>
<s> Street railway gas electric corporations are organized ostensibly to serve the community actually enabling a greedy group to make more money </s>
<s> Again what cannot be gained by request is won by force and guile </s>
<s> Over and over again the various processes are repeated until you have built up a sort of City Monstrous dedicated to machinery in which all the men and many of the women are just machines and there is no ideal save that of feverish industrial adventure and accomplishment </s>
<s> Powerblind ruthless marvelworking bending backs and bodies to its willis Pittsburg's god and Success its divine attribute Success that spells Gold the instrument of exploitation and sensation </s>
<s> What wonder that weaker men confronted by the colossal rewards of industrial conquest are frenzied with the gold fever </s>
<s> In the absence of communal patriotism graft becomes an incident </s>
<s> Graft and greed are the minor watchwords of success </s>
<s> Get money anywaybut get it </s>
<s> Is it surprising that cashiers graft that aldermen graft that city officials graft that there's a very pandemonium of graft </s>
<s> Isn't it the way the other fellows get rich </s>
<s> All of a sudden the poison clogs the pores and the infection blotches the surfaceand every one is horrified </s>
<s> The great manufacturers the great merchants the great lawyershigh priests of the Power Godthrow up their hands </s>
<s> Can such things be </s>
<s> Dreadful horrible!blindly oblivious of their own responsibility for the epidemic </s>
<s> More startling still to the conquerors were the pitiless revelations of the Survey exhibiting in mathematical terms the cost to the human factor of this monstrous material success </s>
<s> Hordes of anaemic emaciated men and women exhausted by long hours of toil piled thick in wretched hovels underfed halfclothed dragging out a miserable existence unrelieved by leisure or rest or recreationthe Juggernaut toll of efficiencyof the passion for results at any price </s>
<s> Against this horror what avails Pittsburg's panorama of splendid churches of lordly palaces of noble art museums of great orchestras richly endowed educational institutionsthe patriotic tribute of the conquerors to civilization </s>
<s> What is this boasted civilization of ours worthnot Pittsburg's only for Pittsburg is an incidentif it be reared on the wrecked and depleted bodies of men at its base </s>
<s> There would then be the opportunity in the article to suggest the regenerated Pittsburgall this furious energy hitherto devoted to material success turned to social betterment and decent government </s>
<s> The turn of the worker comes </s>
<s> The conquerors having learned that they cannot take greedily what belongs to a community and find happiness turn magnificently to the rescue of their own downtrodden </s>
<s> The old questionwhat does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?has been burned into Pittsburg humanity once again </s>
<s> For several years the newspapers have carried stories about these successive scandals in Pittsburg until people have in a measure become confused as to how they connect whether all are really parts of the same story </s>
<s> I doubt if the average man who reads the article in the morning paper has a clear grasp of what has been going on and he can't discover it without hunting back through the files </s>
<s> Once we published an article by Owen Wister about the Capitol frauds in Pennsylvania after the newspapers had been printing countless columns on the subject for months and it was one of the most successful articles we have used because of the way it crystallized and interpreted the whole occurrence </s>
<s> A similar service is here suggested </s>
<s> Write the story of Pittsburg dramatically crystallize the big exposures of the last few years through which bankers and politicians have been going to prison culminating with the present crisis in the City Council bring out the economic significance of these occurrences to Pittsburg to the United States </s>
<s> Such an article will help all of us to see where we are at will help develop civic consciousness in New York Chicago San Francisco </s>
<s> It is immensely well worth doing </s>
<s> I'm not dictating your article </s>
<s> What is written here is purely suggestive </s>
<s> You must tell what you see and find in your own way </s>
<s> You will anyway </s>
<s> You know most of the facts </s>
<s> You are in touch with the balance </s>
<s> We'll help to get material </s>
<s> If you will you can put up an article that the country will read </s>
<s> We'd like copy as soon as possible </s>
<s> Sincerely J </s>

<s> COSGRAVE Editor </s>
<s> Mr. Whitlock replied expressing willingness to handle the subject along the lines indicated and asked for whatever assistance we could render him </s>
<s> William Hard a member of our editorial force had spent some time in Pittsburg acquiring material for his Woman's Invasion and he recommended J </s>

<s> Here is an account of his service which was accompanied by a letter from District Attorney Blakeley certifying to his reliability and knowledge of the facts </s>

<s> After that we waited rather impatiently it must be confessed for Whitlock's manuscript </s>
<s> After the passage of other admonitory letters and telegrams we received the following letter </s>
<s> We print it instead of an article </s>
<s> In our opinion it is an extraordinarily valuable summary of the whole subject of municipal misrule </s>
<s> It goes far and beyond Pittsburg and deep into economic social and national conditions of which that city is but an instance and an illustration </s>
<s> And moreover it sets forth just how such an article could we find the right man to do it should be written </s>
<s> Here it is Executive Offices THE CITY OF TOLEDO 3 June 1910 </s>
<s> JOHN O'HARA COSGRAVE EsquireEditor EVERYBODY'S MAGAZINE </s>
<s> DEAR MR. COSGRAVE The Pittsburg story is big too big and too important and too significant to do at second hand </s>
<s> I have had a valuable correspondence with Mr. Nordman and he has most kindly put his information and in clear form at my disposal </s>
<s> He has sent me his scrapbook of newspaper clippings and he has written me at length and in detail of the various exposures and prosecutions </s>
<s> I have made inquiries too from friends and I have been thinking over the story that you propose </s>
<s> But it won't go and I have concluded that it ought not to go in that form and that is the only form in which it is possible for me now to tell it </s>
<s> I find just what I expected to find or I find the familiar symptoms of what I expected to find </s>
<s> The intelligent answers to the several questions I put to Mr. Nordman after our first few letters are exactly what I expected them to be </s>
<s> One city is all cities and all exhibit the same effects proceeding from the same causes </s>
<s> Look about you anywhere and if you see graft and bribery and corruption you'll find a bipartisan machine controlling nominations and elections to municipal offices and representing the few who consider themselves privileged to exploit the people by means of franchises in public utilities etc </s>
<s> It's as easy as it is for a physician to tell what ails a sallow and emaciated Southern cracker who shivers with chills one day and burns up with fever the next </s>
<s> And so in Pittsburg I found the usual Republican machine with its big boss the usual Democratic machine and its little boss and the two as usual working together the Democratic boss and his tools rewarded by a few small offices on bipartisan boards and the like then the street railway system and other public utility corporations which these bosses represent and for which they procure franchises </s>
<s> And after this the better element the eminently respectable citizens supporting this combination enjoying the fruits of its labor and influencing the business interests of the city in the way that gives such perfect exemplification of the evils of class government in our citiesthe same old sordid story </s>
<s> The revelations as they are calledthough by this time they should have ceased to be revelations and have become recognitions in this countrymade by the newspaper clippings before me are the expected indications of the deeper underlying causes </s>
<s> The superficial observer sees in them merely a corrupt council and from the fact that councilmen have taken bribes he makes the daring deduction that some one gave them the bribes he sees that councilmen have been grafting and then is naively astonished by the revelation that some business men higher up although not very much higher up have been caught and publicly disgraced </s>
<s> He sees too a brave and fearless prosecutor who is sending these men to prison and there are the usual predictions that out of all this there is to come to Pittsburg good governmentthat is government by honest men to be aided perhaps by the adoption of the commission plan </s>
<s> That is to say we have here the subject only in its personal aspect and not in its institutional sociological economic aspect </s>
<s> THE SAME OLD STORY OF GRAFT Now to be frank the story of the grafting doesn't interest me much though it is as saddening and depressing as ever and I can't work up enough enthusiasm for that feature of it to write anything that would be worth your while to print or worth anybody's while to read </s>
<s> Toward the subject I feel the same apathy that was felt toward the ordinary newspaper account of some casualty by Thoreau who would not read as you will remember the accountsfor exampleof crimes and accidents because having once grasped the principle he felt it unnecessary to multiply indefinitely instances of that principle </s>
<s> The story of Pittsburg so far as it has been related to me is merely the old squalid story of municipal graft </s>
<s> I have the names and the dates in an orderly and logical waywho were sent to the penitentiary and when and for what particular crime and what the judge said in pronouncing sentence etc </s>
<s> All of this has been told over and over and over again in the newspapers and magazines during the last few years the only difference lies in the names and the dates and the place </s>
<s> Indeed Pittsburg's story in this respect is hardly as interesting as the old storiesit is if anything more commonplace more squalid </s>
<s> But behind all this there is of course a story and a big one as you unerringly divined </s>
<s> Reading between the lines of the dry recital of facts with which I have been provided and peering a little way behind the scenes I come I think upon the real story the one that some one should write the one that some one should print </s>
<s> The first chapter perhaps is the story of the old political machines in Pittsburg and of that interesting andin certain elemental human sensesstrong personality Chris Magee the bosswho has a monument </s>
<s> Then there is another personality of a different sort in Blakeley the district attorney </s>
<s> My accounts are meager and bald and yet I catch glimpses of a striking personality </s>
<s> This district attorney I should imagine is a man with the best ideals of the legal profession honest capable sincere and unafraid a man withal who knows life and politics and can play the game without being soiled in its many contacts </s>
<s> What draws me to him even at this distance is that he seems to have little of the Puritan in him as there is too apt to be in prosecutors who convict and push their victims within prison doors </s>
<s> And he is another chapter of the story </s>
<s> But I don't know Blakeley I can't describe him I can't interpret him and I haven't the time nor the opportunity just now to become acquainted with him </s>
<s> Then there is the story of the organization of the Civic League or whatever they call it and especially the story of its operations </s>
<s> These good citizens it seems hired a detective to come and run their men down for them </s>
<s> To me the private detective is not the most inspiring and heroic figure on our modern scene but that is neither here nor there </s>
<s> One of these detectives evidently has not only ability but versatility and in an interesting manner combines the occupation of a detective with the profession of an evangelist </s>
<s> It was not however he who worked the old panel gamemuch as a black paramour might work it down in the Tenderloinon certain councilmen led them into a trap and then exposed theman achievement in confused morals that has not been permitted to go unapplauded </s>
<s> There are those of course in every city who could think fondly and smugly of themselves as doing in this way preeminently the will of God and such deeds not infrequently make men selfrighteous </s>
<s> But of course I may be mistaken about the present application of this generalization and as I should like to be just or what is better to be charitable I should hesitate on such unsupported conclusions to write it down for the public eye </s>
<s> There are of course those who with logic can justify the larger end by the smaller means and thus excuse certain deviations from the straight line of the moral ideal and thereby hold one back from the temptation to divide his moral indignation about equally between pursuer and pursued </s>
<s> But if he claimed one's sympathy for the pursuers he could not prevent one's pity from going to the ruined councilmen </s>
<s> THE SHOCK TO CARNEGIE But beyond all thisand here I think I touch on the real storythere is the peculiar temper and tendency of Pittsburg </s>
<s> Pittsburg is an artistic center fortunes have been lavished in endowing schools and universities and palaces for art on symphonies and oratorios </s>
<s> All the expressions of a new ruling plutocracy are easily discernible here as in all such epochs of society recorded in history just for instance as Ferrero describes them in the last phases of the Roman Republic </s>
<s> And when Carnegie returns he sheds tears and wrings his hands because of the corruption that has been exposed and he fails as many in Pittsburg seem to fail to note the necessary if subtle relation that must exist between all this corruption and debauchery between all this art and music andshall I say?the tariff on steel </s>
<s> This however isn't all though this is part </s>
<s> Pittsburg is a moral town the most moral in the conventional sense in all America </s>
<s> She won't even allow the kids to play baseball on a back lot on Sunday </s>
<s> A woman an old friend of mine who lives in Pittsburg said I think it very unfortunate that the Survey was published </s>
<s> It overlooks Pittsburg's good points </s>
<s> For instance Pittsburg has more churches than any city of its size in America </s>
<s> More people of our class go to church than in any place I ever saw more money is given to charity </s>
<s> People just pour out of their houses and into the churches on Sunday morning </s>
<s> She was quite seriousand she expressed Pittsburg or the ruling class of Pittsburg exactly </s>
<s> Now I don't mean to say that Pittsburg is especially hypocritical but she does seem to be pharisaical </s>
<s> The article about Pittsburg should find its beginnings perhaps away back in the days of scholasticism and come down through the moss hags of Scotland and its title should be Pious Pittsburg or something like that </s>
<s> Written properlyif I am rightit would be an eloquent exposition of phariseeism at its apotheosis </s>
<s> THE REAL STORY OF PITTSBURG Now I can't write this because I haven't the evidence to prove what I see or think I see </s>
<s> All I have is the mere outlineand the outline applies as I have said to most cities </s>
<s> What one should have is the color the detail the thousand and one little things in the way of personalityyou know what I mean all that which is necessary to lend artistic verisimilitude to an otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative </s>
<s> I wish I were in New York tonight </s>
<s> I'd go to the Casino and see the revival of The Mikado </s>
<s> The Pittsburg story can't be written and it should not be written without this and to do it properly one would have to spend much time in Pittsburg and become saturated with the atmosphere of the place and when he emerged if he ever did emerge he would be ready to undertake this rather stupendous study in psychology </s>

<s> Vol. XXIII No.2 AUGUST 1910 THE WOMEN OF TOMORROW page 215226 part 1 </s>
<s> By WILLIAM HARD EDITOR'S NOTE It is commonly supposed that only the women of poverty are affected by modern industrial conditions </s>
<s> On the contrary modern industrial conditions are having their greatest influence among the women who before marriage enjoy wide educational opportunities and who after marriage enjoy the blessing of partial leisure </s>
<s> It is among these women that economic developments are producing the profoundest changes in habit of life and in character of mind </s>
<s> Mr Hard who will be remembered by all readers of the Woman's Invasion has spent two years in the diligent investigation of this subject and has acquired an authoritative knowledge of it </s>
<s> EVERY Jack has his Jill </s>
<s> It is a tender twilight thought and it more or less settles Jill </s>
<s> When the Census Man was at work in 1900 however he went about and counted 2260000 American women who were more than twentyfive years old and who were still unmarried </s>
<s> It is getting worse or better with every passing decade and out of it is emerging a new ideal of education for women an ideal which seems certain to penetrate the whole educational system of the United States all the way from the elementary schools to the universities </s>
<s> The Census Man groups us into age periods </s>
<s> The period from twentyfive to twentynine is the most important matrimonially because it is the one in which most of us get pretty well fixed into our life work </s>
<s> Out of every 1000 women in that period in the year 1890 the Census Man found 254 who were still unmarried </s>
<s> In 1900 only ten years later he found 275 </s>
<s> There is not so much processional as recessional about marriage at present </s>
<s> In navigating the stormy waters of life in the realistic pages of the census reports it is not till we reach the comparatively serene landlocked years from fortyfive to fiftyfour that we find ourselves in an ageperiod in which the number of single women has been reduced to less than ten per cent </s>
<s> of the total </s>
<s> The rebound from this fact hits education hard </s>
<s> As marriage recedes and as the period of gainful work before marriage lengthens the need of real technical preparation for that gainful work becomes steadily more urgent and the United States moves steadily onward into an era of trained women as well as trained men </s>
<s> In Boston at that big new college called Simmonsthe first of its kind in the United Statesa regular fouryear college of which the aim is to send out every graduate technically trained to earn her living in a certain specific occupation there were enrolled last year besides some five hundred undergraduate women some eighty other women who had already earned their bachelor's degrees at other colleges such as Bryn Mawr Wellesley Smith Vassar Radcliffe Leland Stanford and the University of Montana </s>
<s> These eighty women after eight years in elementary schools four years in high school and four years in college were taking one year more in technical school in order to bewhat </s>
<s> Not doctors or lawyers or architects </s>
<s> Not anything in the learned professions </s>
<s> But to be social workers in settlements or for charity societies to be librarians to be stenographers and secretaries </s>
<s> The Bachelor of Arts from Vassar who is going to be a stenographer and who is taking her year of graduate study at Simmons will go to work at the end of the year and then six months later if she has made good will get from Simmons the degree of Bachelor of Science </s>
<s> At that point in her life she will have two degrees and seventeen years of schooling behind her </s>
<s> A big background </s>
<s> But we are beginning to do some training for almost everything </s>
<s> Did you ever see a school of salesmanship for departmentstore women employees </s>
<s> You can see one at the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston </s>
<s> Under the guidance of Mrs. Lucinda W </s>
<s> Prince the big department stores of Boston have come to think enough of this school to send girls to it every morning and to pay them full wages while they take a three months' course </s>
<s> If you will attend any of the classes in arithmetic in textiles in hygiene in color and design in demonstration sales in business forms you will get not only a new view of the art of selling goods over the counter but a new vision of a big principle in education </s>
<s> In the class on color for instance you will at first be puzzled by the vivid interest taken by the pupils in the theory of it </s>
<s> You have never before observed in any classroom so intimate a concern about rainbows prisms spectra and the scientific sources of aesthetic effects </s>
<s> Your mind runs back to your college days and returns almost alarmed to this unacademic display of genuine spontaneous unanimous enthusiasm toward a classroom study of a theoretical subject </s>
<s> At last the reason for it works into your mind </s>
<s> These girls are engaged in the practice of color every afternoon over hats ribbons waists gloves costumes </s>
<s> When you begin once to study a subject which reaches practice in your life you cannot stop with practice </s>
<s> A law of your mind carries you on to the philosophy of it </s>
<s> Right there you see the reason why trade training broadly contrived broadens not only technique but soul trains not only to earn but to live </s>
<s> Refined selling some of the girls call the salesmanship which they learn in Mrs. Prince's class </s>
<s> They have perceived to some extent the relation between the arts and sciences on the one hand and their daily work on the other </s>
<s> To a much greater extent has this relation been perceived by the young woman who has taken the full fouryear course in say Secretarial Studies in Simmons and who throughout her English her German her French her Sociology and her History as well as throughout her Typewriting her Shorthand and her Commercial Law has necessarily kept in mind irradiating every subject the light it may throw on the specific work she is to do </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> There precisely is the danger </s>
<s> Every Jack should have his Jill but if every Jill has her job why there again the wedding day goes receding some more into the future </s>
<s> Let them stop all this foolishness and get married as their grandparents did </s>
<s> Poor Jack </s>
<s> Poor Jill </s>
<s> They get lectured at all the time about the postponement of marriage and they can no more control it than they can control the size of the city of New York </s>
<s> Theoretically everybody on Manhattan Island could get up and go away and leave the island vacant </s>
<s> Actually it can't and won't be done </s>
<s> Theoretically we should all of us get married young </s>
<s> We fall in love young enough </s>
<s> But actually we can't get married young and don't </s>
<s> The reasons are given later </s>
<s> Meanwhile just notice and just ponder the following facts </s>
<s> It was in the United States as a whole that the Census Man found 275 out of every 1000 women in the twentyfivetotwentynine ageperiod unmarried </s>
<s> But the United States consists of developed and undeveloped regions </s>
<s> The cities are the high points of development </s>
<s> Look at the cities In Chicago out of every 1000 women in the age period from twentyfive to twentynine there were 314 who were unmarried </s>
<s> In Denver there were 331 </s>
<s> In Manhattan and the Bronx there were 356 </s>
<s> In Minneapolis there were 369 </s>
<s> In Philadelphia there were 387 </s>
<s> Southern New England however is the most industrially developed part of the United States the part in which social conditions like those of the older countries of the world are most nearly reached </s>
<s> In Fall River out of every 1000 women in the twentyfivetotwentynine period the unmarried were 391 </s>
<s> In New Haven they were 393 </s>
<s> In Boston they were 452 </s>
<s> In view of such facts how can anybody object to the steps which have been taken recently toward giving the women in the manufacturing trades as well as the women in the commercial trades some little preparation for the work in which they are likely to spend so many years </s>
<s> In the Manhattan Trade School for Girls in the last eighteen months of record the enrollment was 1169 </s>
<s> More and more the girls in this school are willing to stay in it for a full year </s>
<s> They have finished at least five grades of the public school and they are now learning to be milliners to be dressmakers to be operators of electricpower machines to be workers in paste and glue in such occupations as candleshademaking to be workers with brush and pencil in furnishing the manufacturing trades with designs </s>
<s> It is not only a matter of learning to do one particular thing in one particular department in one particular trade </s>
<s> That they could learn in a factory </s>
<s> It is a matter of getting some understanding of a whole trade or getting some kind of a view of how the world is run </s>
<s> Nobody wants to make people into machines </s>
<s> The object of a good trade school is precisely the reverse </s>
<s> It is the common school which makes people into machines when it sends them directly from books which do not explain the working world out into that world to become uncomprehending appendages to minute processes in infinitely subdivided manufacturing organizations </s>
<s> A good trade school besides teaching the technique of the machine covers what Mrs. Woolman the director of the Manhattan School in her wonderful report of last year called the middle ground between general academic preparatory work on the one hand and practical trade training on the other </s>
<s> In this middle ground the pupil takes simple courses in for instance Civics and Industries </s>
<s> Nothing to it says an irritated manufacturer </s>
<s> Nothing to it at all </s>
<s> I can't get a good office boy any more </s>
<s> I can't get anybody boy or girl who wants to do anything but just hold down a job and grab a payenvelope </s>
<s> Too much schooling </s>
<s> Those inventors and pioneers who came out of New England and made this country from a huntingground into an empirethey didn't have all this monkeybusiness in technical schools and trade schools </s>
<s> They just went to work </s>
<s> That's all </s>
<s> I say send 'em to work young and let 'em sweat </s>
<s> That's what makes men and women </s>
<s> My dear sir those early New Englanders were in trade schools from the time they began to crawl on the floor among their mothers' looms and spinningwheels </s>
<s> There was hardly a home in early New England that didn't give a large number of technical courses in which men and women were always teaching by doing and the boys and girls were always learning by imitating </s>
<s> The facts about this are so simple and so familiar that we don't stop to think of their meaning </s>
<s> When in the spring the woodashes from the winter fires were poured into the lyebarrel and water was poured in with them and the lye began to trickle out from the bottom of the barrel and the winter's savings of grease were brought out and the grease and the lye were boiled together in the big kettle and mother had finished making the family's supply of soap for another year the children had taken not only a little lesson in industriousness by helping to make the soap but a little lesson in industry too by observing the technique and organization of the soap business from start to finish </s>
<s> A boy from that family even if he never learned to read or write might some day have some IDEAS about soap </s>
<s> The curriculum of an old New England home so far as presided over by the wife may be incompletely suggested as follows N </s>

<s> These departments might give a girl a pretty fair education of the hand and a pretty fair acquaintance with the technique and organization of the working world but we haven't yet mentioned the biggest and hardest department of all </s>
<s> Before mentioning it we call attention to a picture reproduced in this article from a book published in the year 1493 </s>
<s> The book was a French translation of Boccaccio's collection of stories called Noble Women </s>
<s> The picture shows a woolen mill being operated in the grounds of a palace by a queen and her ladiesinwaiting </s>
<s> It summons back the days when even the daughters of kings and nobles could not help acquiring a knowledge of the working world because they were in it </s>
<s> One of the ladies inwaiting is straightening out the tangled strands of wool with cardingcombs </s>
<s> The other has taken the combed and straightened strands and is spinning them into yarn </s>
<s> The queen being the boss has the best job </s>
<s> She is weaving the yarn into cloth on a loom </s>
<s> The daughters of the Emperor Charlemagne who was a very rich man learned how to card and spin and weave </s>
<s> Noble women had to boss all that kind of thing on their estates </s>
<s> They lived in the very midst of Industry of Business </s>
<s> So it was with those early New England women </s>
<s> And therefore whether welltodo or indigent they passed on to their sons as well as to their daughters a steady daily lesson in the world's work </s>
<s> The most intelligent mother in the United States today let her be kindergartner and psychologist and childstudyspecialist as much as she pleases cannot give her children that broad early view of the organization of life </s>
<s> The only place where her children can get it now is in the school </s>
<s> On the first of January of this year Mrs. Ella Flagg Young superintendent of schools in Chicago took algebra out of the eighth grade of the elementary schools and in its place inserted a course on Chicago </s>
<s> Large parts of what was once the Home are now spread out through the Community </s>
<s> The new course will teach the life of the community its activities and opportunities civic aesthetic industrial </s>
<s> Such a course is nothing but Home Training for the enlarged Home </s>
<s> But we must go back for a moment to that biggest and hardest department of all in the old homes of New England </s>
<s> Deceit weeping spinning God hath give To women kindly that they may live said Chaucer in a teasing mood </s>
<s> But spinning was a very small part of the Department of Textiles </s>
<s> We forbear to dilate on the courses of instruction which that department offered </s>
<s> We confine ourselves to observing that First </s>
<s> In the SubDepartment of Flax after heckling that flax with combs of increasing degrees of fineness till the fibers lay pretty straight after spinning it into yarn on her spinningwheel after reeling the yarn off into skeins after bucking the skeins in hot lye through many changes of water and after using shuttle and loom to weave the stuff into cloth the home woman of those days had to accomplish some twenty subsequent processes of bucking rinsing possing drying and bleaching before the cloth was ready for use </s>
<s> Second </s>
<s> In the SubDepartment of Wool in addition to being carders spinners and weavers women were dyers handling all the color resources of the times boiling pokeberries in alum to get a crimson using sassafras for a yellow or an orange and producing a black by boiling the fabric with fieldsorrel and then boiling it again with logwood and copperas </s>
<s> We pass over as trivial the making of flax and wool stuffs into articles of actual use </s>
<s> We say nothing about the transformation of cloth into clothes tablecovers napkins nothing about the weaving of yarn on little lap looms into the narrow fabrics for hairlaces gloveties belts garters and hatbands nothing about the incessant knitting of yarn into mittens and stockings nothing about a host of other details </s>
<s> They were for idle moments </s>
<s> Sweet domestic days when girls stayed at home and helped their mothers and let father support the family </s>
<s> It seems as if even Rip Van Winkle in his most shiftless mood ought to have been able to support a large number of daughters under such conditions </s>
<s> Does it astonish you that they matured young </s>
<s> There all about them from babyhood were the basic processes by which the world was sheltered clothed and fed </s>
<s> Those processes were numerous but simple </s>
<s> Boys and girls observed them absorbed them through eyes through fingertips all through those early years when eyes and fingertips are the nourishing points of the intellect </s>
<s> John Winthrop the first governor of Massachusetts Bay Colony was married at seventeen </s>
<s> His parents were not only willing but aiding and abetting </s>
<s> They considered him a man </s>
<s> Mercy Otis in Revolutionary days in Massachusetts the wife of the patriot James Warren and Abigail Smith the wife of the future president John Adams both married before twenty </s>
<s> A study of their lives will show that at that age they were mature </s>
<s> Today in Boston a woman of twenty is considered so immature that many of the hospitals will not admit her even to her preliminary training for the trade of nurse till she has added at least three years more to her mental development </s>
<s> Who has thus prolonged infancy who has thus postponed maturity </s>
<s> No individual </s>
<s> Science has done part of it </s>
<s> By the invention of powerdriven machines and by the distribution of the compact industries of the home through the scattered innumerable business enterprises of the community Science has given us in place of a simple and near world a complicated and distant one </s>
<s> It takes us longer to learn it </s>
<s> Simultaneously by research and also by the use of the printingpress the locomotive and the telegraph wire which speed up the production as well as the dissemination of knowledge Science has brought forth in every field of human interest and of human value a mass of facts and of principles so enormous and so important that the labors of our predecessors on this planet overwhelm us and we grow to our full physical development long before we have caught up in any degree with the previous experience of the race </s>
<s> And till we have done that to some degree we are not mature </s>
<s> With this postponement of personal maturity there is an even greater postponement of what might be called technical maturity </s>
<s> The real mastery of a real technique takes longer and longer </s>
<s> The teacher must not only go to college but must do graduate work </s>
<s> The young doctor after he finishes college and medical school is found as an interne in hospitals as an assistant to specialists as a traveler through European lecturerooms </s>
<s> The young engineer the young architect the young specialist of every sort finds his period of preparation steadily extending before him </s>
<s> What is left undone by Science in keeping us immature is finally accomplished by System </s>
<s> The world is getting organized </s>
<s> Except in some of the professions and often even in them we most of us start in on our life work at some small subdivided job in a large organization of people </s>
<s> The work of the organization is so systematized as to concentrate responsibility and remuneration toward the top </s>
<s> In time from job to job up an ascent which grows longer as the organization grows bigger we achieve responsibility </s>
<s> Till we do we discharge minor duties for minimum pay </s>
<s> This is just as true of the boy from a middle class family as it is of the boy from a working class family </s>
<s> There follows however a most important difference between them </s>
<s> The middle class boy will have to work longer and go farther than the working class boy in order to rise to the financial standards of his class </s>
<s> In this respect the working class boy will be a man ready for marriage long before his middle class fellowworker </s>
<s> It is among middle class boys then that the period of infancy is most prolonged </s>
<s> They get a good deal of schooling </s>
<s> The stores of human knowledge are put in their hands to some extent and to some extent they catch up with the experience of the race </s>
<s> This takes a longer and longer effort particularly if real mastery of any real technique is attempted </s>
<s> Then on going to work they find that System supplementing Science has perfected such an organization of the world of work that they must stay for quite a while in the ranks of the organization </s>
<s> They will not soon be earning what is regarded among their friends as a marrying income </s>
<s> In money as well as in mind they approach marriage with increasing tardiness </s>
<s> Their prolonged infancy is financial as well as mental </s>
<s> They say that college girls marry late </s>
<s> It is true enough </s>
<s> But it isn't properly stated </s>
<s> The girls in the kind of family which college girls come from marry late </s>
<s> It can be definitively established by statistics here considerately omitted that the age of marriage of college girls is no later than the age of marriage of their noncollege sisters and acquaintances </s>
<s> College is not a cause </s>
<s> It is a symptom </s>
<s> Out of the prolongation of infancy in the middle class has come the conquest by women of the intellectual freedom of the world </s>
<s> It was by no vagary of chance that the demand of women for the higher education came simultaneously with the change from the old industrial home to the new more purely domestic home </s>
<s> It may be a higher nobler type of home </s>
<s> We are not here discussing that point </s>
<s> As the home ceased to provide its daughters with adequate education and with adequate employment what was their situation </s>
<s> In the working class it was simply this That they went into factories and that their sweethearts married them somewhat later than had previously been the case because their share as wives in the support of the family was increasingly smaller </s>
<s> But the working class man soon reaches his maximum earning capacity in his craft and stays there </s>
<s> His financial infancy is short compared with that of the middle class man </s>
<s> He therefore marries younger </s>
<s> In the middle class however Science and System began to lengthen the mental and financial infancy of the men to such an extent that the old maid of twentythree became common </s>
<s> What were the girls in the middle class to do while the boys were growing up to be men in mind and in money </s>
<s> The father of Frederick the Great used to go about his realm with a stick and when he saw a woman in the street he would shake the stick at her and say Go back into the house </s>
<s> An honest woman keeps indoors </s>
<s> Probably quite sensible </s>
<s> When she went indoors she went in to a job </s>
<s> The middle class daughter of today if her mother is living and housekeeping goes indoors into a vacuum </s>
<s> Out of that vacuum came the explosion which created the first woman's colleges </s>
<s> There was plenty of sentiment in the explosion </s>
<s> That was the splendid blinding part of it </s>
<s> That was the part of it which even today makes us veil our eves before the nobility of such women as Emma Willard and Mary Lyon </s>
<s> They made Troy Female Seminary in the twenties and Mount Holyoke in the thirties in the image of the aspirations as well as in the image of the needs of the women of the times </s>
<s> But the needs were there the need to be something the need to do something selfrespecting self supporting </s>
<s> The existence of these needs was clearly revealed in the fact that from the early women's colleges and from the early coeducational universities there at once issued a large supply of teachers </s>
<s> This goes back to the fountainhead of the higher education of women in this country </s>
<s> Emma Willard even before she founded Troy Female Seminary back in the days when she was running her school in Middlebury Connecticut was training young women to TEACH and was acquiring her claim which she herself subsequently urged to being regarded as the organizer of the first normal school in the United States </s>
<s> From that time to this most college women have taught school before getting married </s>
<s> The higher education of women has been in economic effect a trade school for training women for the trade of teacher </s>
<s> But isn't it the purpose of the colleges to avoid training their pupils for specific occupations </s>
<s> Isn't it their purpose to give their pupils discipline and culture pure and broad unaffected by commercial intention </s>
<s> Isn't that what colleges are and ought to be for </s>
<s> On the shore of this vast and violent controversy we discreetly pause and stealthily sidle off taking note of just three reefs of solid fact which unsubmergably jut out above the surface of the raging waters </s>
<s> First </s>
<s> The colleges instruct their pupils in the subjects which those pupils subsequently teach </s>
<s> Second </s>
<s> The pupils specialize in the subjects which they are going to teach </s>
<s> Third </s>
<s> The colleges besides providing the future teachers with subjects almost always offer to provide them with instruction in the principles of education and frequently offer to provide them with instruction in the very technique of classroom work </s>
<s> Our verdict therefore which we hope will be satisfactory to counsel on both sides is that the college is by no means a trade school but that if the woman who is going to earn her living will choose the one trade of teaching she can almost always get a pretty fair trade training by going to college </s>
<s> We are more interested in observing that the amount of trade training which a teacher is expected to take is increasing year by year </s>
<s> In teaching as in other trades the period and scope of preliminary preparation continue to expand </s>
<s> In the last calendar of Bryn Mawr College the Department of Education in announcing its courses makes the following commonsense remarks It is the purpose of the department to offer to students intending to become teachers an opportunity to obtain a technical preparation for their profession </s>
<s> Hitherto practical training has been thought necessary for teachers of primary schools only but similar training is very desirable for teachers in high schools and colleges also </s>
<s> Indeed it is already becoming increasingly difficult for college graduates without practical and theoretical pedagogical knowledge to secure good positions </s>
<s> In addition to the lectures open to undergraduates courses will be organized for graduate students only conducted with special reference to preparation for the headship and superintendence of schools </s>
<s> But the teaching trade is getting choked </s>
<s> There is too much supply </s>
<s> Girls are going to college in hordes </s>
<s> Graduating from college looking for work there is usually just one kind of work toward which they are mentally alert </s>
<s> Their college experience has seldom roused their minds toward any other kind of work </s>
<s> They start to teach </s>
<s> They drug the market </s>
<s> And so the teaching trade the great occupation of unmarried middle class women ceases to be able to provide those women as a class with an adequate field of employment </s>
<s> It is a turning point in the economic history of the class </s>
<s> At the 1909 annual convention of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae in Cincinnati Miss Susan Kingsbury acting for a committee of which Mrs. Richards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Miss Breckenridge of the University of Chicago were members read a real essay on The Economic Efficiency of College Women </s>
<s> This essay was not written till detailed reports on income and expenditure from 377 selfsupporting college graduates had been got together </s>
<s> Out of these 377 there were 317 who were teachers </s>
<s> There were 183 who had followed up their regular college course with from one to eight years of graduate study </s>
<s> The capital invested in education was from 2500 to 3500 and often amounted to 7000 because of advanced work and travel </s>
<s> After all this preparation the average income achieved may be sufficiently disclosed in the one fact that among those graduates who had been at work for from six to eight years more than seventy per cent </s>
<s> were still earning less than 1100 </s>
<s> After drawing a complete statistical picture of the case Miss Kingsbury concluded with certain questions and recommendations here condensed which show the new economic needs of middle class women knocking at the door of present middle class education Should not the oversupply of teachers be reduced by directing many of our graduates into other pursuits than teaching </s>
<s> This will place upon the college just where the responsibility is due the obligation of discovering what those opportunities are and what preparation should be given </s>
<s> This organization should endeavor to arouse in our colleges a sense of responsibility for knowing the facts with regard to their graduates both social and economic and should also endeavor to influence our colleges through appointment secretaries to direct women according to fitness into other lines than teaching </s>
<s> Should not courses be added to the college curriculum to give women the fundamental principles in other professions or lines of industry or commerce than teaching </s>
<s> May not required courses be added to the college curriculum to inculcate business power and sense in all women </s>
<s> This philosophy seems to aim at making the modern school as informative about modern industry as the primitive home was about primitive industry </s>
<s> It seems to be the same educational philosophy which produced the course on Chicago in the Chicago elementary schools which produced the Manhattan Trade School in New York which produced the School of Salesmanship at the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston </s>
<s> At that Women's Educational and Industrial Union at 264 Boylston Street you may see the evolution toward the age of trained women proceeding at all levels of educational equipment </s>
<s> There before you at one level are the Trade School Shopsa shop in handwork and a shop in millinery </s>
<s> The pupils are graduates of the Boston Trade School for Girls </s>
<s> They have had one year of training </s>
<s> They are now taking another </s>
<s> Florence Marshall made the Boston Trade School with a committee of women to help her </s>
<s> It has now been taken over by the public authorities and merged into the publicschool system </s>
<s> What looked like a private fad has become a public function </s>
<s> The training of women for selfsupport has been recognized as a duty of the state </s>
<s> The Trade School Shops at the Women's Educational and Industrial Union were started for the express purpose of supplementing the work of the Boston Trade School for Girls </s>
<s> One year was not enough </s>
<s> In the Trade School the prospective milliner had spent four months on plain sewing four months on summer hats four months on winter hats </s>
<s> She had also taken short courses in Personal Hygiene Business Forms Spelling Business English Color Design Textiles Industrial Conditions </s>
<s> These latter courses were not strictly speaking technical </s>
<s> They were vocational </s>
<s> They were in the middle ground between general and technical training </s>
<s> They went beyond the general training of the elementary schools and furnished the girl with the background of her future vocation </s>
<s> But she often needed a little more of the foreground a little more of actual trade technique </s>
<s> Thus does her education divide itself up into periodsgeneral vocational technical </s>
<s> The Trade School Shops are designed to give the girl her final technical finish </s>
<s> They are really more like a factory than like a school </s>
<s> Although the object of them is to convey a broad instruction the pupil gets wages the stuff she makes is sold and the organization is that of a commercial establishment </s>
<s> So at the end of two years from the time she left the elementary school the young milliner is ready to go out into the world organization </s>
<s> She is better fitted for her world than many a college girl is for hers </s>
<s> On a different level of educational equipment from the Trade School Shops stands the School of Salesmanship </s>
<s> It gets many high school girls and even occasionally a girl who has been to college </s>
<s> Finally there is the Appointment Bureau for college girls in particular </s>
<s> This Appointment Bureau is the most extraordinary employment agency ever organized </s>
<s> Its object is not merely to introduce existing clients to existing jobs which is the proper normal object of employment agencies but to make forays into the wild region of occupations other than teaching and find jobs and then find girls to fit those jobs </s>
<s> In other words it is a kind of Company of Adventurers Trading into Hudson's Bay for the purpose of exploring surveying developing and settling the region of occupations other than teaching on behalf of college women </s>
<s> It is managed by Miss Laura Drake Gill President of the National Association of Collegiate Alumnae and former Dean of Barnard College </s>
<s> She is assisted by an Advisory Council of representatives of nearby collegesRadcliffe Wellesley Simmons Mount Holyoke Smith and Brown </s>
<s> There is no more important work being done for women today </s>
<s> In connection with it the Women's Educational and Industrial Union has just issued a handbook of three hundred pages entitled Vocations for the Trained Woman </s>
<s> It is an immense map of the occupational world for middle class women in which every bay and headland every lake and hill is drawn to scale from Poultry Farming to Department Store Buying from LunchRoom Management to State ChildSaving </s>
<s> The responses made to this movement by certain educational institutions including particularly Simmons College will be observed in a future article </s>
<s> Just one response from an unexpected quarter must be noticed here </s>
<s> In a small Illinois city there is a woman's college founded as a Preparatory School in the forties and soon advanced to be a Seminary which with Anna P </s>
<s> Sill for its first head Jane Addams for its bestknown graduate and Julia Gulliver for its present president has come to be a college of standing and of leading </s>
<s> Only Troy Female Seminary and Mount Holyoke Seminary preceded it in date of foundation among the important women's institutions </s>
<s> Rockford College is ranked today by the reports of the United States Commissioner of Education in rank oneamong the sixteen best women's colleges in the United States </s>
<s> It hasn't risen to that rank by any quick moneyspurred spurt </s>
<s> It brings with it out of its far past all the traditions of that early struggle for the higher education which by friction kindled among women so flaming an enthusiasm for pure knowledge </s>
<s> It remains collegiate in the old sense quiet cloistral inhabiting oldfashioned brick buildings in an oldfashioned large yard looking still like the Illinois of war times more than like the Illinois of the twentieth century retaining all the home ideals of those timesa large interest in feminine accomplishments a strict regard for manners a belief in the value of charm </s>
<s> But here in this quiet nonmetropolitan college so really academic so reallyin the oldestfashioned wayscultural here is a twoyear course in secretarial studies </s>
<s> It is the first time within our knowledge that such a thing has happened in any of the old firstrank women's colleges </s>
<s> The course in secretarial studies at Rockford gives the pupil English Accounts Commerce Commercial Law and Economic History in her first year and Political Science English and Economics in her second year </s>
<s> Shorthand and Typewriting are required in both years and a few hours a week are reserved in each year for elective courses to be chosen by the pupil among offerings in French German Spanish and History </s>
<s> This is a notable concession not only to the increased need of middle class women for occupations other than teaching but also to the increased recognition of those other occupations as being worthy of cultural training </s>
<s> We keep moving forward into an era of trained women as well as trained men </s>
<s> The extraordinary prolongation of mental and financial infancy in the middle class bringing with it an extraordinary postponement of marriage makes this training particularly necessary in the case of the women of that class </s>
<s> But the contraction of the home as a field of adequate employment for daughters exists everywhere increasing the cost of living for the family and driving daughters to supplementing the family income </s>
<s> What futility as well as indignity there is in the idea that the query of support for women gets its full answer in a husband </s>
<s> In the United States in the year 1900 among women twenty years of age and over the married women numbered 13400000 </s>
<s> The unmarried women and the widows together numbered 6900000 </s>
<s> For every two women married there was one woman either single or widowed </s>
<s> If education does not 1 give women a comprehension of the organization of the moneyearning world and 2 train them to one of the techniques which lead to selfsupport in that world it is not education </s>
<s> Just at this point though we encounter a curious conflict in women's education </s>
<s> Just as we see their urgent need of a moneyearning technique we simultaneously hear coming from a corner of the battlefield and swelling till it fills the air with a nationwide battlecry the sentiment The Home is also a technique </s>
<s> All women must be trained to it </s>
<s> At Rockford College illustrating this conflict there exists besides the course in Secretarial Studies an equivalent course in Home Economics </s>
<s> In one photograph in this article we show the tiny children of the Francis Parker School in Chicago taking their first lesson in the technique of the home </s>
<s> In another picture we show the postgraduate laboratory in the technique of the home at the University of Illinois </s>
<s> And the space between the kindergarten and the degree of Doctor of Philosophy threatens to get filled up almost everywhere with courses in cooking sewing chemistry of diet composition of textiles art of marketing and other phases of home management </s>
<s> The moneyearning world a technique </s>
<s> The home a technique </s>
<s> The boy learns only one </s>

<s> HENRY AUTHOR OF THE FOUR MILLION THE HEART OF THE WEST STRICTLY BUSINESS ETC </s>
<s> I found myself in Texas a recently revisiting old places and vistas </s>
<s> At a sheepranch where I had sojourned many years ago I stopped for a week </s>
<s> And as all visitors do I heartily plunged into the business at hand which happened to be that of dipping the sheep </s>
<s> Now this process is so different from ordinary human baptism that it deserves a word of itself </s>
<s> A vast iron cauldron with half the fires of Avernus beneath it is partly filled with water that soon boils furiously </s>
<s> Into that is cast concentrated lye lime and sulphur which is allowed to stew and fume until the witches' broth is strong enough to scorch the third arm of Palladino herself </s>
<s> Then this concentrated brew is mixed in a long deep vat with cubic gallons of hot water and the sheep are caught by their hind legs and flung into the compound </s>
<s> After being thoroughly ducked by means of a forked pole in the hands of a gentleman detailed for that purpose they are allowed to clamber up an incline into a corral and dry or die as the state of their constitutions may decree </s>
<s> If you ever caught an ablebodied twoyearold mutton by the hind legs and felt the 750 volts of kicking that he can send through your arm seventeen times before you can hurl him into the vat you will of course hope that he may die instead of dry </s>
<s> But this is merely to explain why Bud Oakley and I gladly stretched ourselves on the bank of the nearby charco after the dipping glad for the welcome inanition and pure contact with the earth after our muscleracking labors </s>
<s> The flock was a small one and we finished at three in the afternoon so Bud brought from the morral on his saddle horn coffee and a coffeepot and a big hunk of bread and some side bacon </s>
<s> Mr. Mills the ranch owner and my old friend rode away to the ranch with his force of Mexican trabajadores </s>
<s> While the bacon was frizzling nicely there was the sound of horses' hoofs behind us </s>
<s> Bud's sixshooter lay in its scabbard ten feet away from his hand </s>
<s> He paid not the slightest heed to the approaching horseman </s>
<s> This attitude of a Texas ranchman was so different from the oldtime custom that I marveled </s>
<s> Instinctively I turned to inspect the possible foe that menaced us in the rear </s>
<s> I saw a horseman dressed in black who might have been a lawyer or a parson or an undertaker trotting peaceably along the road by the arroyo </s>
<s> Bud noticed my precautionary movement and smiled sarcastically and sorrowfully </s>
<s> You've been away too long said he </s>
<s> You don't need to look around any more when anybody gallops up behind you in this state unless something hits you in the back and even then it's liable to be only a bunch of tracts or a petition to sign against the trusts </s>
<s> I never looked at that hombre that rode by but I'll bet a quart of sheep dip that he's some doubledyed son of a popgun out rounding up prohibition votes </s>
<s> Times have changed Bud said I oracularly </s>
<s> Law and order is the rule now in the South and the Southwest </s>
<s> I caught a cold gleam from Bud's pale blue eyes </s>
<s> Not that I I began hastily </s>
<s> Of course you don't said Bud warmly </s>
<s> You know better </s>
<s> You've lived here before </s>
<s> Law and order you say </s>
<s> Twenty years ago we had 'em here </s>
<s> We only had two or three laws such as against murder before witnesses and being caught stealing horses and voting the Republican ticket </s>
<s> But how is it now </s>
<s> All we get is orders and the laws go out of the state </s>
<s> Them legislators set up there at Austin and don't do nothing but make laws against kerosene oil and schoolbooks being brought into the state </s>
<s> I reckon they was afraid some man would go home some evening after work and light up and get an education and go to work and make laws to repeal aforesaid laws </s>
<s> Me I'm for the old days when law and order meant what they said </s>
<s> A law was a law and a order was a order </s>
<s> But I began </s>
<s> I was going on continued Bud while this coffee is boiling to describe to you a case of genuine law and order that I knew of once in the times when cases was decided in the chambers of a sixshooter instead of a supreme court </s>
<s> You've heard of old Ben Kirkman the cattle king </s>
<s> His ranch run from the Nueces to the Rio Grande </s>
<s> In them days as you know there was cattle barons and cattle kings </s>
<s> The difference was this when a cattleman went to San Antone and bought beer for the newspaper reporters and only give them the number of cattle he actually owned they wrote him up for a baron </s>
<s> When he bought 'em champagne wine and added in the amount of cattle he had stole they called him a king </s>
<s> Luke Summers was one of his range bosses </s>
<s> And down to the king's ranch comes one day a bunch of these Oriental people from New York or Kansas City or thereabouts </s>
<s> Luke was detailed with a squad to ride about with 'em and see that the rattlesnakes got fair warning when they was coming and drive the deer out of their way </s>
<s> Among the bunch was a blackeyed girl that wore a number two shoe </s>
<s> That's all I noticed about her </s>
<s> But Luke must have seen more for he married her one day before the caballard started back and went over on Canada Verde and set up a ranch of his own </s>
<s> I'm skipping over the sentimental stuff on purpose because I never saw or wanted to see any of it </s>
<s> And Luke takes me along with him because we was old friends and I handled cattle to suit him </s>
<s> I'm skipping over much what followed because I never saw or wanted to see any of itbut three years afterward there was a boy kid stumbling and blubbering around the galleries and floors of Luke's ranch </s>
<s> I never had no use for kids but it seems they did </s>
<s> And I'm skipping over much what followed until one day out to the ranch drives in hacks and buckboards a lot of Mrs. Summers's friends from the Easta sister or so and two or three men </s>
<s> One looked like an uncle to somebody and one looked like nothing and the other one had on corkscrew pants and spoke in a tone of voice </s>
<s> I never liked a man who spoke in a tone of voice </s>
<s> I'm skipping over much what followed but one afternoon when I rides up to the ranch house to get some orders about a drove of beeves that was to be shipped I hears something like a popgun go off </s>
<s> I waits at the hitching rack not wishing to intrude on private affairs </s>
<s> In a little while Luke comes out and gives some orders to some of his Mexicanhands and they go and hitch up sundry and divers vehicles and mighty soon out comes one of the sisters or so and some of the two or three men </s>
<s> But two of the two or three men carries between 'em the corkscrew man who spoke in a tone of voice and lays him flat down in one of the wagons </s>
<s> And they all might have been seen wending their way away </s>
<s> `Bud' says Luke to me `I want you to fix up a little and go up to San Antone with me.' `Let me get on my Mexican spurs' says I `and I'm your company.' One of the sisters or so seems to have stayed at the ranch with Mrs. Summers and the kid </s>
<s> We rides to Encinal and catches the International and hits San Antone in the morning </s>
<s> After breakfast Luke steers me straight to the office of a lawyer </s>
<s> They go in a room and talk and then come out </s>
<s> `Oh there won't be any trouble Mr. Summers' says the lawyer </s>
<s> `I'll acquaint Judge Simmons with the facts today and the matter will be put through as promptly as possible </s>
<s> Law and order reigns in this state as swift and sure as any in the country.' `I'll wait for the decree if it won't take over half an hour' says Luke </s>
<s> `Tut tut' says the lawyer man </s>
<s> `Law must take its course </s>
<s> Come back day after tomorrow at halfpast nine.' At that time me and Luke shows up and the lawyer hands him a folded document </s>
<s> And Luke writes him out a check </s>
<s> On the sidewalk Luke holds up the paper to me and puts a finger the size of a kitchendoor latch on it and says `Decree of absolute divorce with custody of the child.' `Skipping over much what has happened of which I know nothing' says I `it looks to me like a split </s>
<s> Couldn't the lawyer man have made it a strike for you?' `Bud' says he in a pained style `that child is the one thing I have to live for </s>
<s> SHE may go but the boy is mine!think of itI have custody of the child.' `All right' says I </s>
<s> `If it's the law let's abide by it </s>
<s> But I think' says I `that Judge Simmons might have used exemplary clemency or whatever is the legal term in our case.' You see I wasn't inveigled much into the desirableness of having infants around a ranch except the kind that feed themselves and sell for so much on the hoof when they grow up </s>
<s> But Luke was struck with that sort of parental foolishness that I never could understand </s>
<s> All the way riding from the station back to the ranch he kept pulling that decree out of his pocket and laying his finger on the back of it and reading off to me the sum and substance of it </s>
<s> `Custody of the child Bud' says he </s>
<s> `Don't forget itcustody of the child.' But when we hits the ranch we finds our decree of court obviated nolle prossed and remanded for trial </s>
<s> Mrs. Summers and the kid was gone </s>
<s> They tell us that an hour after me and Luke had started for San Antone she had a team hitched and lit out for the nearest station with her trunks and the youngster </s>
<s> Luke takes out his decree once more and reads off its emoluments </s>
<s> `It ain't possible Bud' says he `for this to be </s>
<s> It's contrary to law and order </s>
<s> It's wrote as plain as day hereCustody of the child </s>
<s> ' `There is what you might call a human leaning' says I `towards smashing 'em bothnot to mention the child.' `Judge Simmons' goes on Luke `is a incorporated officer of the law </s>
<s> She can't take the boy away </s>
<s> He belongs to me by statutes passed and approved by the state of Texas.' `And he's removed from the jurisdiction of mundane mandamuses' says I `by the unearthly statutes of female partiality </s>
<s> Let us praise the Lord and be thankful for whatever small mercies' I begins but I see Luke don't listen to me </s>
<s> Tired as he was he calls for a fresh horse and starts back again for the station </s>
<s> He come back two weeks afterwards not saying much </s>
<s> `We can't get the trail' says he `but we've done all the telegraphing that the wires'll stand and we've got these city rangers they call detectives on the lookout </s>
<s> In the meantime Bud' says he `we'll round up them cows on Brusby Creek and wait for the law to take its course.' And after that we never alluded to allusions as you might say </s>
<s> Skipping over much what happened in the next twelve years Luke was made sheriff of Mojada County </s>
<s> He made me his office deputy </s>
<s> Now don't get in your mind no wrong apparitions of a office deputy doing sums in a book or mashing letters in a cider press </s>
<s> In them days his job was to watch the back windows so nobody didn't plug the sheriff in the rear while he was adding up mileage at his desk in front </s>
<s> And in them days I had qualifications for the job </s>
<s> And there was law and order in Mojada County and schoolbooks and all the whisky you wanted and the government built its own battleships instead of collecting nickels from the schoolchildren to do it with </s>
<s> And as I say there was law and order instead of enactments and restrictions such as disfigure our umpire state today </s>
<s> We had our office at Bildad the county seat from which we emerged forth on necessary occasions to soothe whatever fracases and unrest that might occur in our jurisdiction </s>
<s> Skipping over much what happened while me and Luke was sheriff I want to give you an idea of how the law was respected in them days </s>
<s> Luke was what you would call one of the most conscious men in the world </s>
<s> He never knew much book law but he had the inner emoluments of justice and mercy inculcated into his system </s>
<s> If a respectable citizen shot a Mexican or held up a train and cleaned out the safe in the express car and Luke ever got hold of him he'd give the guilty party such a reprimand and a cussin' out that he'd probable never do it again </s>
<s> But once let somebody steal a horse unless it was a Spanish pony or cut a wire fence or otherwise impair the peace and indignity of Mojada County Luke and me would be on 'em with habeas corpuses and smokeless powder and all the modern inventions of equity and etiquette </s>
<s> We certainly had our county on a basis of lawfulness </s>
<s> I've known persons of Eastern classification with little spotted caps and buttonedup shoes to get off the train at Bildad and eat sandwiches at the railroad station without being shot at or even roped and drug about by the citizens of the town </s>
<s> Luke had his own ideas of legality and justice </s>
<s> He was kind of training me to succeed him when he went out of office </s>
<s> He was always looking ahead to the time when he'd quit sheriffing </s>
<s> What he wanted to do was to build a yellow house with latticework under the porch and have hens scratching in the yard </s>
<s> The one main thing in his mind seemed to be the yard </s>
<s> `Bud' he says to me `by instinct and sentiment I'm a contractor </s>
<s> I want to be a contractor </s>
<s> That's what I'll be when I get out of office.' `What kind of a contractor?' says I </s>
<s> `It sounds like a kind of a business to me </s>
<s> You ain't going to haul cement or establish branches or work on a railroad are you?' `You don't understand' says Luke </s>
<s> `I'm tired of space and horizons and territory and distances and things like that </s>
<s> What I want is reasonable contraction </s>
<s> I want a yard with a fence around it that you can go out and set on after supper and listen to whippoorwills </s>
<s> I'm a fool about whippoorwills' says Luke </s>
<s> That's the kind of a man he was </s>
<s> He was homelike although he'd had bad luck in such investments </s>
<s> But he never talked about them times on the ranch </s>
<s> It seemed like he'd forgotten about it </s>
<s> I wondered how with his ideas of yards and chickens and notions of latticework he'd seemed to have got out of his mind that kid of his that had been taken away from him unlawful in spite of his decree of court </s>
<s> But he wasn't a man you could ask about such things as he didn't refer to in his own conversation </s>
<s> I reckon he'd put all his emotions and ideas into being sheriff </s>
<s> I've read in books about men that was disappointed in these poetic and finehaired and highcollared affairs with ladies renouncing truck of that kind and wrapping themselves up into some occupation like painting pictures or herding sheep or science or teaching schoolsomething to make 'em forget </s>
<s> Well I guess that was the way with Luke </s>
<s> But as he couldn't paint pictures he took it out in rounding up horse thieves and in making Mojada County a safe place to sleep in if you was well armed and not afraid of requisitions or tarantulas </s>
<s> One day there passes through Bildad a bunch of these money investors from the East and they stopped off there Bildad being the dinner station on the I </s>
<s> & G </s>
<s> N </s>
<s> They was just coming back from Mexico looking after mines and such </s>
<s> There was five of 'emfour solid parties with gold watch chains that would grade up over two hundred pounds on the hoof and one kid about seventeen or eighteen </s>
<s> This youngster had on one of them cowboy suits such as tenderfoots bring West with 'em and you could see he was aching to wing a couple of Indians or bag a grizzly or two with the little pearlhandled gun he had buckled around his waist </s>
<s> I walked down to the depot to keep an eye on the outfit and see that they didn't locate any land or scare the cow ponies hitched in front of Murchison's store or act otherwise unseemly </s>
<s> Luke was away after a gang of cattle thieves down on the Frio and I always looked after the law and order when he wasn't there </s>
<s> After dinner this boy comes out of the diningroom while the train was waiting and prances up and down the platform ready to shoot all antelope lions or private citizens that might endeavor to molest or come too near him </s>
<s> He was a goodlooking kid only he was like all them tenderfootshe didn't know a lawandorder town when he saw it </s>
<s> By and by along comes Pedro Johnson the proprietor of the Crystal Palace chiliconcarne stand in Bildad </s>
<s> Pedro was a man who liked to amuse himself so he kind of herdrides this youngster laughing at him tickled to death </s>
<s> I was too far away to hear but the kid seems to mention some remarks to Pedro and Pedro goes up and slaps him about nine feet away and laughs harder than ever </s>
<s> And then the boy gets up quicker than he fell and jerks out his little pearlhandle andbing </s>
<s> bing </s>
<s> bing </s>
<s> Pedro gets it three times in special and treasured portions of his carcass </s>
<s> I saw the dust fly off his clothes every time the bullets hit </s>
<s> Sometimes them little thirtytwos cause worry at close range </s>
<s> The engine bell was ringing and the train starting off slow </s>
<s> I goes up to the kid and places him under arrest and takes away his gun </s>
<s> But the first thing I knew that caballard of capitalists makes a break for the train </s>
<s> One of 'em hesitates in front of me for a second and kind of smiles and shoves his hand up against my chin and I sort of laid down on the platform and took a nap </s>
<s> I never was afraid of guns but I don't want any person except a barber to take liberties like that with my face again </s>
<s> When I woke up the whole outfittrain boy and allwas gone </s>
<s> I asked about Pedro and they told me the doctor said he would recover provided his wounds didn't turn out to be fatal </s>
<s> When Luke got back three days later and I told him about it he was mad all over </s>
<s> `Why'n't you telegraph to San Antone' he asks `and have the bunch arrested there?' `Oh well' says I `I always did admire telegraphy but astronomy was what I had took up just then.' That capitalist sure knew how to gesticulate with his hands </s>
<s> Luke got madder and madder </s>
<s> He investigates and finds in the depot a card one of the men had dropped that gives the address of some hombre called Scudder in New York City </s>
<s> `Bud' says Luke `I'm going after that bunch </s>
<s> I'm going there and get the man or boy as you say he was and bring him back </s>
<s> I'm sheriff of Mojada County and I shall keep law and order in its precincts while I'm able to draw a gun </s>
<s> And I want you to go with me </s>
<s> No Eastern Yankee can shoot up a respectable and wellknown citizen of Bildad 'specially with a thirtytwo calibre and escape the law </s>
<s> Pedro Johnson' says Luke `is one of our most prominent citizens and business men </s>
<s> I'll appoint Sam Bell acting sheriff with penitentiary powers while I'm away and you and me will take the 6.45 northbound tomorrow evening and follow up this trail.' `I'm your company' says I </s>
<s> `I never see this New York but I'd like to </s>
<s> But Luke' says I `don't you have to have a dispensation or a habeas corpus or something from the state when you reach out that far for rich men and malefactors?' `Did I have a requisition' says Luke `when I went over into the Brazos bottoms and brought back Bill Grimes and two more for holding up the International </s>
<s> Did me and you have a search warrant or a posse comitatus when we rounded up them six Mexican cow thieves down in Hidalgo </s>
<s> It's my business to keep order in Mojada County </s>
<s> ' `And it's my business as office deputy' says I `to see that business is carried on according to law </s>
<s> Between us both we ought to keep things pretty well cleaned up.' So the next day Luke packs a blanket and some collars and his mileage book in a haversack and him and me hits the breeze for New York </s>
<s> It was a powerful long ride </s>
<s> The seats in the cars was too short for sixfooters like us to sleep comfortable on and the conductor had to keep us from getting off at every town that had fivestory houses in it </s>
<s> But we got there finally and we seemed to see right away that he was right about it </s>
<s> `Luke' says I `as office deputy and from a law standpoint it don't look to me like this place is properly and legally in the jurisdiction of Mojada County Texas.' `From the standpoint of order' says he `it's amenable to answer for its sins to the properly appointed authorities from Bildad to Jerusalem.' `Amen' says I </s>
<s> `But let's turn our trick sudden and ride </s>
<s> I don't like the looks of this place.' `Think of Pedro Johnson' says Luke `a friend of mine and yours shot down by one of these gilded abolitionists at his very door!' `It was at the door of the freight depot' says I </s>
<s> `But the law will not be balked at a quibble like that.' We put up at one of them big hotels on Broadway </s>
<s> The next morning I goes down about two miles of stairsteps to the bottom and hunts for Luke </s>
<s> It ain't no use </s>
<s> It looks like San Jacinto day in San Antone </s>
<s> There's a thousand folks milling around in a kind of a roofedover plaza with marble pavements and trees growing right out of 'em and I see no more chance of finding Luke than if we was hunting each other in the big pear flat down below Old Fort Ewell </s>
<s> But soon Luke and me runs together in one of the turns of them marble alleys </s>
<s> `It ain't no use Bud' says he </s>
<s> `I can't find no place to eat at </s>
<s> I've been looking for restaurant signs and smelling for ham all over the camp </s>
<s> But I'm used to going hungry when I have to </s>
<s> Now' says he `I'm going out and get a hack and ride down to the address on this Scudder card </s>
<s> You stay here and try to hustle some grub </s>
<s> But I doubt if you'll find it </s>
<s> I wish we'd brought along some cornmeal and bacon and beans </s>
<s> I'll be back when I see this Scudder if the trail ain't wiped out.' So I starts foraging for breakfast </s>
<s> For the honor of old Mojada County I didn't want to seem green to them abolitionists so every time I turned a corner in them marble halls I went up to the first desk or counter I see and looks around for grub </s>
<s> If I didn't see what I wanted I asked for something else </s>
<s> In about half an hour I had a dozen cigars five story magazines and seven or eight railroad timetables in my pockets and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail </s>
<s> Once a lady sitting at a table and playing a game kind of like pushpin told me to go into a closet that she called Number 3 </s>
<s> I went in and shut the door and the blamed thing lit itself up </s>
<s> I set down on a stool before a shelf and waited </s>
<s> Thinks I `This is a private diningroom.' But no waiter never came </s>
<s> When I got to sweating good and hard I goes out again </s>
<s> `Did you get what you wanted?' says she </s>
<s> `No ma'am' says I </s>
<s> `Not a bite.' `Then there's no charge' says she </s>
<s> `Thanky ma'am' says I and I takes up the trail again </s>
<s> By and by I thinks I'll shed etiquette and I picks up one of them boys with blue clothes and yellow buttons in front and he leads me to what he calls the caffay breakfast room </s>
<s> And the first thing I lays my eyes on when I go in is that boy that had shot Pedro Johnson </s>
<s> He was setting all alone at a little table hitting a egg with a spoon like he was afraid he'd break it </s>
<s> I takes the chair across the table from him and he looks insulted and makes a move like he was going to get up </s>
<s> `Keep still son' says I </s>
<s> `You're apprehended arrested and in charge of the Texas authorities </s>
<s> Go on and hammer that egg some more if it's the inside of it you want </s>
<s> Now what did you shoot Mr. Johnson of Bildad for?' `And may I ask who you are?' says he </s>
<s> `You may' says I </s>
<s> `Go ahead' </s>
<s> `I suppose you're on' says this kid without batting his eyes </s>
<s> `But what are you eating </s>
<s> Here waiter!' he calls out raising his finger </s>
<s> `Take this gentleman's order.' `A beefsteak' says I `and some fried eggs and a can of peaches and a quart of coffee will about suffice.' We talk a while about the sundries of life and then he says `What are you going to do about that shooting </s>
<s> I had a right to shoot that man' says he </s>
<s> `He called me names that I couldn't overlook and then he struck me </s>
<s> He carried a gun too </s>
<s> What else could I do?' `We'll have to take you back to Texas' says I </s>

<s> 3 Lassoing Wild Animals In Africa By GUY H </s>
<s> SCULL Field Manager of the Buffalo Jones African Expedition Editor's Note The wild animals of Africa have been hunted with firearms for many a year and photographed by more than one marksman of the lens </s>
<s> But here is the truly unique expedition into the jungle </s>
<s> The idea that any one should seriously contemplate a journey to Africa for the purpose of lassoing such creatures as sportsmen either shoot or photograph at the longest range possible seems quite absurd </s>
<s> But an American frontiersman has done it with American cowboys cowponies and huntingdogs and with wonderful moving pictures to prove it </s>
<s> It is a fine evidence of the sporting qualities of both parties to the undertaking that Colonel C </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> Jones a Western plainsman could so completely interest Mr. Charles S </s>
<s> Bird an Eastern manufacturer in the fantastic plan as to command his backing </s>
<s> And if there is such a thing as the glow of adventure by proxy it must have been felt in the Nassau Street law office where the Buffalo Jones African Expedition had its headquarters when the cablegram from Nairobi announced that lion and rhino had been lassoed and that the moving pictures were a complete success </s>
<s> IT was a special trainloaded to capacity with horses and dogs camp baggage movingpicture cameras cowboys photographers and porters and when it pulled out of the Nairobi station on the way to the up country of British East Africa the period of preparation passed away and the time of action began </s>
<s> As the faces of the people on the platform glided by the window of the slowly moving carriage there was good will written on all of them but also unbelief </s>
<s> There was no doubt as to what they thought of Buffalo Jones's expedition that was setting out to rope and tie and photograph the wild animals of the East African Veldt </s>
<s> How are you going to hold a rhino that weighs two tons and a half </s>
<s> What are you going to do when the lion charges </s>
<s> Such were the questions asked us by the hunters of the country </s>
<s> They further took pains to explain that a rhino charges like a flash and that a lion can catch a horse within a hundred yards </s>
<s> These items of information however were well known to Buffalo Jones before the expedition was organized in New York and his preparations to meet the difficulties had been made accordingly </s>
<s> Colonel C </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> Jones is tall and spare with a strong rugged face and keen blue eyes </s>
<s> During his sixtyfive years of life he has roped and tied often singlehanded every kind of wild animal of consequence to be found in our western country and his experience with these has led him to believe implicitly that man is the master of all wild beasts </s>
<s> He has climbed trees after mountain lions and with a lasso over a branch has hauled grizzlies up into the air by one hind leg </s>
<s> And once he set out alone to journey over a country that no white man had ever traveled before to reach the land of the muskox on the border of the Arctic Circle </s>
<s> The story is told of how he met a trapper on the way and how these two in the face of the hostility of all the Indian tribes the wolves and the cold of the northern winter eventually came to the muskox and captured five calves </s>
<s> Then deserted by their Indian guide they started to return with their prizes got lost in the wilderness and fought the wolves till their cartridges ran out </s>
<s> And when at last they reached safety and fell asleep exhausted the Indians obeying the laws of their religion stole upon them in the night and killed the calves </s>
<s> But the success he had achieved with the mountain lions of the Southwest the muskox of the North and the grizzly bears of the Rockies was not enough </s>
<s> For twenty years it had been the one ambition of his life to take an outfit to British East Africa to try his hand with the more ferocious big game of that country </s>
<s> But in his Western experience Colonel Jones had learned something else besides the mastery of man over beast </s>
<s> Precisely how an American cowboy was going to hold a rhinoceros that weighed two tons and a half was purely a matter of speculation </s>
<s> Yet of one thing the Colonel was certainthe experiment would result in a moving picture that would be well worth the taking </s>
<s> For this reason what afterward came to be known as the picture department was added to the makeup of the expedition </s>
<s> The preparations extended over a considerable length of time and were carried on in various places </s>
<s> Unquestionably the most important part of the outfit was the horses </s>
<s> It was absolutely essential that they should be Western cowponies fast well trained and reliable in every way </s>
<s> The Colonel who best of all could foresee the nature of the work they would have to do selected them himself ten in all from the ranches of New Mexico and shipped them to New York </s>
<s> The American dogs to be used for trailing were likewise chosen by the Colonel </s>
<s> Some of them belonged to him personally and had been thoroughly tried out </s>
<s> The rest had reputations of their own </s>
<s> Of the two cowboys who were to act as his assistants Marshall Loveless had worked with the Colonel before and knew his methods and Ambrose Means came highly recommended for skill and daring from one of the largest ranch owners in the West </s>
<s> When at the last moment the writer of these articles was introduced to the expedition in the capacity of acting field manager the preparations were well under way </s>
<s> The horses and dogs had been already shipped en route to Africa in charge of the cowboys and the date of our sailing for London had been fixed for the following day </s>
<s> The meeting was held at a luncheon in the Railroad Club in New York </s>
<s> There were present Colonel Jones Mr. F </s>
<s> W </s>
<s> Bird son of Charles S </s>
<s> Bird[1] who financed the expedition Mr. W </s>
<s> G </s>
<s> Sewall of the Boma Trading Company of Nairobi and myself </s>
<s> After certain matters of business had been disposed of the talk at the luncheon table drifted to the probabilities and possibilities of success to lions rhinos elands and cheetahs to cowboys horses and dogs </s>
<s> But the Colonel would hear of no possibilities or even probabilities of failure </s>
<s> He was peculiarly insistent upon this point </s>
<s> And when the hour of the business man's lunch time came to an end and the room began to empty Mr. Sewall said to me across the corner of the table Of course every one in Nairobi will think all of you either fakers or crazy </s>
<s> I know you're no fakers </s>
<s> I don't know whether you're crazy or not </s>
<s> But there is one thing in your favor The Colonel's unshaken belief that the thing can be done will probably pull it through </s>
<s> [1] EAST WALPOLE MASS </s>
<s> July 8 1910 </s>
<s> Mr. GUY H </s>
<s> SCULL </s>
<s> MY DEAR SCULL It has been asked by some what the object of the Buffalo Jones African Expedition was </s>
<s> I will tell you </s>
<s> You know my friend Colonel C </s>
<s> J </s>
<s> Jones broke his rifle a generation or so ago and vowed he would never again kill game save for food or in selfdefense </s>
<s> Since taking that oath he has subdued and captured all kinds of wild animals in North America including the muskox buffalo grizzly bear and cougar </s>
<s> I discovered that it was his dream to go to East Africa to prove that with American cowboys horses and dogs he could lasso and capture the savage animals of that country as readily as he has the wild animals of our country </s>
<s> As a sporting proposition it seemed to me unique and fascinating and so as a small tribute to Colonel Jones I volunteered to finance the expedition </s>
<s> I somewhat doubt whether there is another man in the world who has the courage skill and determination to do what he has done in the animal kingdom and he well deserves to be called The Preserver of the American Bison </s>
<s> I want to acknowledge our indebtedness to Mr. Arthur A </s>
<s> Fowler of New York for his assistance in helping us outfit the expedition in London and Nairobi and to you and the others who have helped to make the expedition a success </s>
<s> Very truly CHARLES S </s>
<s> BIRD </s>
<s> On our arrival in London about the middle of January of this year the work of preparation was continued at once </s>
<s> Outside of the minor details of the outfit such as personal equipment saddlery medicines bandages and so forth the first matter to receive attention was the organization of the picture department </s>
<s> Mr. Cherry Kearton was sought to take charge of this branch of the expedition </s>
<s> Keartona powerfully built Yorkshiremanis an experienced cinematograph photographer and a naturalist of no small reputation </s>
<s> He had taken moving pictures in Africa before and so he knew the climatic conditions therethe heat radiation and the different intensities of light </s>
<s> He also knew the animals the Colonel was going to rope </s>
<s> But besides being a cinematograph expert and a naturalist he was also a sportsman </s>
<s> When Kearton learned of the nature of the undertaking he was skeptical </s>
<s> He had no more than a slight acquaintance with the Colonel then and only a vague hearsay knowledge of what the American Cowboy could do </s>
<s> Evidently his mind was divided by the dictates of common sense and the sporting instinct </s>
<s> On many occasions during this time he questioned the feasibility of the experiment in the light of what he knew of the African beasts </s>
<s> The agreement in documentary form was spread out on the table in the Boma Trading Company's London office when he finally wanted to know how in Heaven's name we thought this thing could be done </s>
<s> We'll do it the Colonel said quietly </s>
<s> That was all </s>
<s> Well there's a picture in it anyway said Kearton and signed the papers </s>
<s> With his assistant David Gobbet two cinematograph machines and tripods hand cameras and developing apparatus he set sail immediately for Africa leaving an order for thirty thousand feet of film to be divided between two manufacturers and to be forwarded as soon as possible </s>
<s> In the meantime Colonel Jones was hard at work collecting a rather unusual assortment of articles </s>
<s> The experience of a lifetime enabled him to foresee what kind of materials were absolutely necessary and what kind might prove useful on the present expedition </s>
<s> Naturally the articles required were not usually in stock but the London shopkeeper is proverbially obliging and imperturbable </s>
<s> One rainy morning the Colonel walked into a hardware store and asked to see some handcuffs </s>
<s> A pair was shown him </s>
<s> Not large enough said the Colonel </s>
<s> How large would you want them sir </s>
<s> Twice that size </s>
<s> May I ask for what purpose you require them sir </s>
<s> For lions said the Colonel </s>
<s> Precisely handcuffs for lions yes you need large ones </s>
<s> I am afraid I have none in stock just now but I can have them made for you within a few days </s>
<s> It was the same with almost everything the Colonel wanted to purchase everything had to be made especially for him after his own descriptionhandcuffs collars and belts chains branding irons a block and fall muzzles of different sizes corkscrew picketpins for holding the turn of a rope and a nondescript article shaped like a huge pair of tongs for which I feel sure there is no name in any trade but which looked to be a handy implement for clamping the jaws of a beast </s>
<s> To have these things made according to specifications took time and an endless amount of running about </s>
<s> Besides there was the more ordinary part of the equipment to procure English dogs both foxhounds and terriers horseblankets extra ropes horseshoes and so on </s>
<s> When the last of the expedition sailed from Southampton there were fortyeight pieces of baggage on the list </s>
<s> This last contingent reached Nairobi at noon on March 3 and for the first time then all the members of the expedition met together </s>
<s> Loveless proved to be a man a little below the medium height he held himself very erect walked with quick energetic steps and wore a blond mustache </s>
<s> He made polite inquiries as to our voyage out commented on the hot weather and fully explained the condition of the horses and dogs </s>
<s> Means was taller </s>
<s> He carried his head slightly forward and wore his black hair brushed low down over his forehead </s>
<s> He stood slumped on one hip so that one shoulder also was lower than the other </s>
<s> Please' to meet you he said </s>
<s> On our arrival at Nairobi the first matter to be decided was the district to be worked </s>
<s> The choice lay between the Sotik and the Kapeti Plains </s>
<s> According to the usual batch of contradictory stories in such cases the game was said to be equally plentiful or equally scarce in both districts </s>
<s> Both had been shot over considerably of late and anyhow no one could really tell us where the most game was to be found because as one informant explained the game everywhere shifted so frequently and so fast </s>
<s> But the Sotik and the country approaching itthe Kedong and Rift Valleys and the Mauwere reported to be more or less free from ticks and as the health of the horses was of the gravest importance to us we determined to work this district first </s>
<s> The Colonel and his two cowboys Loveless and Means were ready to start at once </s>
<s> Eight out of the ten horses were in fine condition </s>
<s> With but one exception the dogs had come through safely though all were suffering somewhat from distemper </s>
<s> It was concluded however that they would recover just as rapidly in the open country as they would in Nairobi </s>
<s> Kearton and Gobbet were ready </s>
<s> Kearton had built a dark room in Nairobi because his earlier experience had taught him that the pictures could not be developed with any degree of satisfaction in the field </s>
<s> His four special porters to carry the cameras and tripodsporters he had trained on previous safariswere only waiting for the word to move </s>
<s> Mr. Ray Ulyate the white hunter to the expedition had already gone to Kijabe to prepare his oxwagons against our coming and the Boma Trading Company had engaged a special train to leave Nairobi on the fifth </s>
<s> On the morning of that day we held the customary procession of an outgoing safari down the main street of Nairobi to the waiting train </s>
<s> The Colonel rode first with the assorted pack of dogs at his horse's heels </s>
<s> Then came the cowboys with the led horses then the picture department then the long single line of black porters bringing up the rear </s>
<s> Above the loads on the porters' heads two flags flashed their colors in the sunlightthe stars and stripes and the house flag of the company with the white buffalo skull against the red background and underneath the motto Sapiens qui Vigilat </s>
<s> The night had already fallen black and cold when the special train crested the top of the divide and coasted down grade into Kijabe </s>
<s> The most imposing structure in the place is the railroad station with its red wooden building propped up on piles its tin guesthouse alongside and the neat gravel platform growing a clump of trees </s>
<s> The rest of Kijabe is composed of four other houses the goodsshed an openfaced Indian booth the postoffice and the watertank </s>
<s> Ulvate met us with a lantern for the station lights are dim and we detrained in the face of the high wind that always blows there from sunset to dawn and picketed the horses among the trees of the station platform </s>
<s> Because a large part of the revenue of the country is derived from the visiting hunters a safari is accorded privileges out of the ordinary </s>
<s> So as a matter of course we took possession of the station and camped in the tin guesthouse for the night </s>
<s> The morning came clear and hot and still </s>
<s> The railroad at Kijabe runs along the face of the hills so that the land drops down abruptly to the plains below and you can look away for miles over the Kedong and Rift valleys with the two sentinel extinct volcanoes rising black against the heatblurred sky The floors of the valleys are laid with volcanic ash </s>
<s> But on first appearances the land looks much the same as the regulation veldt or certain parts of our own Western plains </s>
<s> It is only by the fineness of the dust that hangs about the horses' feet and the peculiar quality of the thirst that dries in the throat that you know this is no ordinary soil </s>
<s> The sun was high in the heavens before we finally started from Kijabe and descended the rough road to the level ground with the brakes on the oxwagons squealing harshly and the horses treading silently in the dust </s>
<s> We had planned to camp at Sewell's farm that night </s>
<s> It was only about four hours away but a short trek the first day is always a good rule to follow </s>
<s> It gives every one a chance so to speak to shake down well into the saddle </s>
<s> We had gone but a short distance however when one thing became strikingly apparent Gobbet did not know how to ride </s>
<s> He was mounted on a white African pony that we had found it necessary to add to our string </s>
<s> The pony was stolid lazy and easygaited but Gobbet's unfamiliar attitude toward his mount was unmistakable </s>
<s> Now it is a delicate matter in any country to broach the question of a man's horsemanship but presently Gobbet introduced the subject of his own accord </s>
<s> Of course I can't ride a horse he said </s>
<s> Have never been on one before </s>
<s> When Mr. Kearton spoke to me about coming out here with him he just asked me if I could ride and I told him surely I could ridebut I didn't tell him I meant a bicycle </s>
<s> After all the matter was of no great importance </s>
<s> Gobbet was young and thin and active with sharp black eyes and the work that lay ahead of us would probably teach him to ride in short orderand it did </s>
<s> We had little expectation of finding either a lion or a rhino on that first day's trip </s>
<s> We were traveling on a regular road making a kind of initial march </s>
<s> The fringe of scrub at the beginning of the valley had been left behind some three or four miles when Ulyate suddenly reined in his horse and pointed to three black dots on the veldt about half a mile away </s>
<s> The black dots proved to he only warthogs but we wanted them and so long as there was little chance of our finding any of the more important species of game we took the opportunity that offered </s>
<s> The Colonel and the two cowboys tightened their cinches and then rode out to the westward to round up the beasts </s>
<s> Drive 'em back to us Kearton called after them and Means waved his hand by way of answer </s>
<s> Behind us the line of porters was coming up along the road </s>
<s> They were straggling badly broken up into little sections of threes and fours so that the last of them were not yet in sight </s>
<s> Gobbet was sent back to hurry forward the four special porters with the cameras and when these finally arrived upon the scene their faces covered with dust and sweat the horsemen had dwindled to dots only a little larger than the hogs themselves </s>
<s> Kearton placed the cameras a few yards apart and there we waited watching the distant specks </s>
<s> Two of the riders disappeared into a far patch of scrub </s>
<s> The third began swinging to the southward </s>
<s> His horse was galloping after something we could not see </s>
<s> In the meantime the safari was coming up and as each section arrived it was halted and the porters put down their loads and sat on them </s>
<s> Some of them turned their backs upon the scene in total indifference as to what was coming next others regarded the cameras with expressions of mild curiosity </s>
<s> Little by little the third horseman had swung round so that he was headed due east riding straight at us </s>
<s> Rapidly the speck grew larger and the two other riders came out of the scrub and joined the chase </s>
<s> Nearer and nearer they came with the dust cloud swirling behind them </s>
<s> Gobbet began turning the handle of his camera and the whir of the machine sounded loud in the stillness </s>
<s> One or two of the porters jumped to their feet and pointed </s>
<s> Kearton waited </s>
<s> I hope they won't come straight into the lens he said </s>
<s> If they do it won't make a good picture </s>
<s> They ought to come at an angle </s>
<s> So he explained placing his hand obliquely to the line of focus </s>
<s> Then he bent over laid his eye to the gunsight of the machine and likewise began turning </s>
<s> The thunder of the chase could be heard now and we could see that it was Loveless leading on his black with Means and the Colonel close behind and the warthog some forty yards ahead </s>
<s> The beast was running strong </s>
<s> His huge snout was thrust forward and his upturned tusks gleamed in the sunlight </s>
<s> But gradually the black horse gained on him and Loveless loosened the rope from his saddle and began swinging the long noose round and round his head </s>
<s> On came the warthog straight for Kearton's camera </s>
<s> Kearton straightened up above the machine and waved his helmet frantically </s>
<s> Give over give over </s>
<s> he shouted </s>
<s> You're driving him right into the picture </s>
<s> It's no good </s>
<s> Give over </s>
<s> The chase never swerved an inch and Kearton bent to his work again cursing in wellselected periods </s>
<s> The next moment the hog drove past him </s>
<s> At the same instant Loveless threw his rope and caught the beast by one hind leg </s>
<s> The black horse stopped fore feet planted firmly and the dust cloud swept across and hid the scene </s>
<s> When the dust cleared away the hog was lying across the road blowing comfortably with the rope leading from his hind leg to the horn of Loveless' saddle </s>
<s> Loveless laughed </s>
<s> There's the first one for you he said </s>
<s> And my can't he run </s>
<s> Gobbet however was indignant </s>
<s> It's no use he complained </s>
<s> To bring an object that way straight into the lens is against the first principles of cinematography </s>
<s> It's no use I tell you </s>
<s> Means sat half slumped in his saddle with his reeking horse panting heavily </s>
<s> Well well well he finally drawled </s>
<s> And didn't Mr. Pig come abending across that prairie </s>
<s> He most certainly come abending </s>
<s> The porters gathered around and looked long at the beast some of them spoke a few words in low tones and the others nodded their heads and smiled </s>
<s> Sometimes a warthog will act nasty and his lower tusks are sharp as razors but when this one was released he walked out of the circle of grinning natives slowly quietly and apparently thoroughly disgusted </s>
<s> At Sewell's farm there is a pan of water made by a dam across an almost waterless brook and alongside of this pan we pitched our camp </s>
<s> When the sun set the high wind rose again whirling up the dust in heavy clouds and sending the sparks from the fire scurrying over the ground </s>
<s> But the Kedong Valley wind is more or less a phenomenon of the country </s>
<s> You can count upon it absolutely for every one of its disagreeable qualities </s>
<s> I think the citizens of Africa are a little proud of it </s>
<s> There was now a fair chance that on our way into the Rift Valley we should flush one or another of the larger animals </s>
<s> Preparations for such a contingency were accordingly made before starting from Sewell's farm </s>
<s> Canteens and iron drums were filled with water because the next camp would be a dry one </s>
<s> The cinematograph cameras and all the extra boxes were loaded with films the evening before and the four special camera porters were given strict orders to keep well up with the advance of the safari </s>
<s> The liontaming outfitthe tongs muzzles chains and collarswas stowed on the first wagon on top of the load where it could be got at readily in case of need </s>
<s> The Colonel rode ahead with the two cowboys close behind all three ropers mounted on their best horsesthe Colonel on the paint Loveless on his black and Means on the bigboned bay </s>
<s> Every member of the party was especially cautioned to keep a sharp lookout on both sides of the road </s>
<s> Just as the day before the morning came hot and still and for hour after hour the straggling safari crawled slowly over the long waves of the undulating veldt </s>
<s> The road was a wagon track always vanishing in front toward the head of the valley </s>
<s> The land lay silent beneath the glaring sunlight </s>
<s> We outspanned at noon for an hour </s>
<s> Over the country here grew small scattered thorn trees thick with thorns but with scarcely any leaves so that the shade beneath them was thin and could shelter no more than one horse </s>
<s> The water in the canteens cold at the start had become warm now </s>
<s> When we mounted again the sweat had dried on the horses and the boots felt stiff on our feet </s>
<s> The line of the road still stretched away its interminable length until it disappeared in the distance </s>
<s> And then as we crawled sleepily ahead over the rises the Colonel was the first to notice the lion spoor in the dust </s>
<s> With sudden animation the safari awoke from the lethargy of the hot monotonous march </s>
<s> The spoor was judged to be at least four hours old so there was no use putting the dogs on it </s>
<s> Then presently it disappeared </s>
<s> On the dead grass of the bordering veldt there was nothing to show which way the lion had gone </s>
<s> But there was a chancea small one yet still a chancethat the beast was lying up near by in the shade of a thorn tree </s>
<s> So all the horsemen spread out over the veldt to obtain a wider scope of vision and for mile after mile the company moved forward sweeping the immediate country </s>
<s> Proceeding in this manner through the afternoon we eventually crested a slightly higher rise and looked down into a shallow valley that was greener than the rest of the veldt </s>
<s> A few fullsized trees were growing in the bottom and there were a number of outcroppings of rock </s>
<s> Large herds of antelope were grazing there </s>
<s> The Colonel called a halt </s>
<s> There is no lion anywhere hereabouts he said because the game are grazing peacefully </s>
<s> But there is a bunch of eland yonder </s>
<s> We might as well round them up while the light lasts </s>
<s> The plan of operation was quickly made </s>
<s> The cameras were stationed about a mile to the southeast partly concealed by the bole of a tree and the bunch of eland were skillfully rounded up and a good specimen was singled out </s>
<s> Everything was working to perfection </s>
<s> The three horsemen drove the eland toward the camerasnot directly at them but a little to one side at an angle as Kearton wanted it done </s>
<s> At the proper moment Loveless roped the animal by the forelegs and neck and threw it down </s>
<s> Loveless jumped from his horse and was running forward to tie the prize when somethingthe smell of the strange beast perhapsstarted the black horse bucking </s>
<s> With the rope made fast to the saddle and the eland acting as a pivot the black went careering round and round </s>
<s> Both the Colonel and Means tried to rope him and missed and finally Loveless on foot caught him by the dangling reins </s>
<s> Of course such a thing might have been readily foreseen but somehow it came as a surprise and opened up grave possibilities </s>
<s> That night in camp at Rugged Rocks we were gathered about the cook s fire for the warmth it gave when the Colonel spoke of the affair </s>
<s> Everything was going great till that horse started bucking the Colonel remarked </s>
<s> We've got to teach our horses not to mind the smell of these strange animals out here </s>
<s> We've got to be able to depend absolutely on our horses </s>
<s> Of course that eland wasn't dangerous </s>
<s> But when we tackle something else and a horse acts that way it might be bad </s>
<s> But Gobbet said it was good action anyway and would look fine when thrown on the screen </s>
<s> March 8 was a day of disappointments </s>
<s> Between sunrise and sunset we traveled fifteen miles to the Wangai River and hunted in turn a pair of lions a cheetah and a rhinocerosand lost them all </s>
<s> Two circumstances were held accountable one was the necessity of getting the horses to water and the other was the fact that it was just a bad luck day all through </s>
<s> We came upon the lions early in the morning close to the base of the southern volcano </s>
<s> This particular pair of lions must have been shot over at one time or another for they did not wait to satisfy any curiosity as to our intentions but fled at once for the safety of the mountain </s>
<s> Although we gave chase immediately their lead was so great and the distance to the mountains so short that they were soon lost to us in the gullies and crevices of the foothills </s>
<s> It was while we were trying to pick up the lost trail of the lions that we flushed a cheetah out of one of the dongas.[2] It broke away along the foothills and finally stopped at bay in a district where the going was so bad for the horses that we had to give up the attempt </s>
<s> [2] Donga.a gully </s>
<s> With the rhinoceros we had scarcely any chance whatsoever </s>
<s> The Colonel who was scouting the country to the northward of the line of march caught a glimpse of the beast in the adjacent valley </s>
<s> By the time he had come back to get us and we had ridden in pursuit the rhino had disappeared </s>
<s> We found his trail leading still farther to the northward and dismounted and looked down at it in silence </s>
<s> No comments were made </s>
<s> No comments were necessary </s>
<s> Every one knew that for lack of water the horses were too done up to follow </s>
<s> Means had dismounted a little to one side of the group and for a while he stood there with his arms resting on his saddle gazing back over the way we had come </s>
<s> Presently he remarked to the world at large Excitement has certainly been runnin' high all day </s>
<s> We mounted then and instead of hunting the rhino farther we rode the jaded horses slowly into camp and put a proper finish to a bad luck day by holding a consultation </s>
<s> The Wangai River is no river at all merely a small spring in the shadow of the range that crosses the head of the valley </s>
<s> But the spring could supply sufficient water for all our needs </s>
<s> Also the problem of transportation demanded that Ulyate should return to Kijabe and bring up another wagon with supplies before the journey over the Mau into the Sotik could be undertaken </s>
<s> Then too here in the Rift Valley we had seen both lion and rhino and there was always the chance of finding them again </s>
<s> The consultation resulted in the decision to make a permanent camp here and hunt the neighboring country until Ulyate should return </s>
<s> For the succeeding three days the Colonel laid out a plan of campaign simple but effective and limited only by the necessity of keeping within reasonable distance of the water </s>
<s> The plan consisted of a series of drives one in a northeasterly one in an easterly and one in a southeasterly direction </s>
<s> By this means we would cover in turn all the territory at the head of the valley </s>
<s> The Colonel was anxious to try again for the rhino he had seen on the march the day before and for this reason the drive to the northeast was inaugurated first </s>
<s> Every member of the expedition took part in these drives </s>
<s> The Colonel and the writer at one end and the two cowboys at the other occupied the extreme positions </s>
<s> Between the right and left wings stretched a long line of porters under the command of two escaris and with Kearton and Gobbet in the center with the cameras </s>
<s> The dogs on leash and the saises carrying water for the horses brought up the rear </s>
<s> When finally formed the line of the drive extended approximately five miles and the cameras and the dogs were so placed that they could be brought to either end of the line with the utmost despatch </s>
<s> Two shots fired in quick succession would be the signal to gather </s>
<s> That first day's drive brought little success </s>
<s> To begin with we were late in starting so that the sun had already risen before we moved out of camp and besides the porters were new at that kind of work and had to be halted and reformed many times before they understood what was wanted </s>
<s> The land across which we were driving lay at the very edge of the valley and was consequently somewhat broken into small hills and hollows </s>
<s> By the time we came to the old rhino trail the day was well advanced </s>
<s> But no fresh tracks were to be found up and down the entire length of the hollow nor was anything to be seen of the beast from the next hill to the northward which we climbed to search the country ahead </s>
<s> There was only a large herd of hartebeests grazing on the plains below </s>
<s> The Colonel retreated halfway down the hill and fired two shots from his revolver </s>
<s> Somewhere beyond our range of vision we heard the two shots repeated and at the end of a little more than half an hour all the members of the drive were gathered on the hillside below the crest </s>
<s> Then the Colonel explained the reason for his signal </s>
<s> The rhino was not there </s>
<s> We might still find him and we might not </s>
<s> The chances were now that we should not </s>
<s> He had probably left the country for good and was already miles away </s>
<s> In the meanwhile a good opportunity offered for rounding up the herd of hartebeests in the plain below and driving them up the hillside to the cameras </s>
<s> On top of the hill was a small clearing the edges of which were fringed with scrub </s>
<s> While the Colonel and the cowboys maneuvered to circle the herd Kearton placed the cameras in the clearing with the northern line of scrub as a background for the intended picture </s>
<s> For a long time there was silence </s>
<s> Then suddenly the scrub sprang into life and the next instant the herd dashed into the clearing in a cloud of dust that was pierced by a hundred startled eyes and tossing horns </s>
<s> At the sight of the cameras the herd broke and scattered in every direction but the horsemen pressing them close roped one in the open and held him to have his picture taken and then let him go </s>
<s> On the second drive over the lowlands to the east the porters worked better but although we covered a far greater territory the total result was the roping and photographing of a servalcat that we flushed on the way back to camp </s>
<s> The third drive carried us well out toward the southern volcano where we had seen the lions on the march from Rugged Rocks but this time there was no trace of them anywhere in the land </s>
<s> Means however found a cheetah and the two faint reports of his signal brought us together on the run </s>
<s> We came upon Means seated on his horse in a bit of the veldt that was covered all over with tufts of rank grass so that it looked like a swamp that had been dry for ages </s>
<s> Near by ran a small shallow donga </s>
<s> When the rest of us rode up to him he merely pointed at one of the tufts of grass behind which the cheetah lay crouched </s>
<s> There followed a brief delay while a plan of maneuver was made and expounded while the tripods were set up the cameras screwed on and the ropers moved out to their appointed places </s>
<s> Then all at once the cheetah started and instead of breaking away as we had calculated he would he doubled on his tracks and made for the shelter of the donga </s>
<s> It was a quick sharp raceand the cheetah won </s>
<s> He hid in the scrub at the bottom of the ditch </s>
<s> The native porters collected there and complacently regarded the scene and the members of the drive ranged themselves on either bank and offered innumerable suggestions as to what had better be done next </s>
<s> But in the midst of it all the Colonel put an emphatic end to the discussion </s>
<s> He rode into the donga with his rope swinging free and when the cheetah failed to spring at him he dropped the noose over the animal's head and dragged him out on to the open veldt where his picture could be properly taken </s>
<s> The black porters looking on commenced speaking in low tones in their native tongue and nodded and grinned at each other as they had done before </s>
<s> But this time Mac was among them </s>
<s> Mac was Kearton's tentboy </s>
<s> He originally came from Somaliland and spoke English </s>
<s> He was called upon to explain what the porters said </s>
<s> Please he began </s>
<s> They are very bad men these people but don't be sorry </s>
<s> They saythey say that of course the white gentlemen are able to do what they want to do but just the same they are all crazy </s>
<s> That night we held our second consultation </s>
<s> Ulyate had returned from Kijabe with the extra wagonload of supplies which placed us in a position to move again immediately </s>
<s> The question now arose as to whether it would be best to remain where we were a few days longer to gain more experience or to trek at once over the Mau with a chance at giraffe on the way and so on into the Sotik country with its alluring promises of both rhino and lion </s>
<s> By this time we had hunted the Rift Valley thoroughly </s>
<s> During the seven days since we had left Kijabe the expedition had roped and photographed a cheetah a servalcat a hartebeest an eland and a warthog </s>
<s> Although we had been given no opportunity yet to find out how we were going to hold a rhino or what we would do when the lion charged still in addition to our success with the lesser animals we had acquired something else of value </s>
<s> All the members of the expedition had learned to work well togetherin all the usual emergencies each man knew what was expected of him and could likewise make a ready guess as to what the others intended doing </s>
<s> Thus in spite of the fact that on an expedition of this kind it is the unexpected that always happens our experience only added to our confidence that when we eventually encountered one of the larger beasts we should get him </s>
<s> The consultation ended with the unanimous decision to start for the Sotik at dawn </s>

<s> By WILLIAM HARD II THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT SUBJECT </s>
<s> Dear General Reader please let that sentence stand for the thousand words much like those of a competent barker at the door of a showtent which you usually oblige an author to expend on enticing you into reading his article </s>
<s> Think how much time you save by walking straight into the tent and observing that THE First International Congress on Domestic Science and Arts was held in 1908 at Freiburg in Switzerland </s>
<s> It as no improvised amateur uplift privatetheatricals affair </s>
<s> The head of the organizing committee was M. Python president of Freiburg's State Council </s>
<s> Seventytwo papers on technical topics were printed and circulated beforehand </s>
<s> The participating members numbered seven hundred </s>
<s> The discussions developed the characteristic points of the three rival breeds of householdarts instructionthe German the Swiss and the Belgian </s>
<s> Visits were made to the normal schools of Freiburg Berne and Zurich in each of which there is an elaborate system for the training of householdarts teachers </s>
<s> In the end in order that facts and ideas about the education of girls for their duties as housekeepers might be more rapidly circulated it was voted to establish at some place in Switzerland a Permanent International Information Committee </s>
<s> Thus in an age in which the productive tasks of the home have almost all been surrendered to the factory in an age in which even cooking and sewing last puny provinces of a once ample empire are forever making concessions of territory to those barbarian invaders the manufacturers of readytoeat foods and readytowear clothes in an age in which home industry lies fainting and gasping while Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Gilman begs the spectators to say thumbsdown and let her put it out of its agony altogetherin such an age there comes at Freiburg in this First International Congress on Domestic Science and Arts the most serious the most notable recognition </s>
<s> ever given in any age to the home's economic value </s>
<s> A real paradox </s>
<s> Well at any rate it gives wings to the fluttering thought that theories of industrial evolution one's own as well as Mrs. Gilman's are a bit like automobilesnot always all that they are cranked up to be </s>
<s> Certainly the revival of the home seems to attract larger crowds to the mourners' bench every year </s>
<s> At the University of Missouri the first crop of graduates in Home Economics was gathered this last spring </s>
<s> They were seven </s>
<s> And as most of them took likewise a degree in Education it may be assumed that they will go forth to spread the gospel </s>
<s> Their preceptress Miss Edna D </s>
<s> Day who next year will head the justorganized Department of Home Economics in the University of Kansas is a novel type of new woman in that she has earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Woman's Sphere </s>
<s> She took graduate work in the Department of Home Administration in the University of Chicago and achieved her doctorate with an investigation into The Effect of Cooling on the Digestibility of Starch </s>
<s> What she found out was subsequently printed as a bulletin by the United States Department of Agriculture </s>
<s> In the midst of the festivities at the wake held over The Home it perplexes the mourners to learn that some of those domestic science bulletins of the United States Department of Agriculture excite a demand for a million copies </s>
<s> It is a wake like Mike McCarthy's </s>
<s> Mike was lookin' iligant As he rested there in state </s>
<s> But When the fun was at its height McCarthy sat up straight </s>
<s> The ballad one of the most temperately worded of literary successes goes on to say that the effect was great </s>
<s> So it has been in this casegreat enough to be felt all the way around the world </s>
<s> It is being felt in the Island Empire of the East </s>
<s> Miss Ume Tsuda's Institute at Tokyo which stands so high that its graduates are allowed to teach in secondary schools without further government examination has installed courses in English domestic science as well as in the domestic science of Japan </s>
<s> It is being felt in the Island Empire of the West </s>
<s> King's College of the University of London has organized a threeyear course leading to the degree of Mistress of Home Science and has also established a PostGraduates' Course in Home Science in which out of fourteen students in this its first year of existence four are graduates of the courses of academic study of Oxford or Cambridge </s>
<s> It is being felt in the United States at every educational level </s>
<s> It has familiarized us with household arts in the public schools and we are not astonished to learn that in the public schools of Boston in every grade above the third there is sewing or cooking or both for 120 minutes every week for every girl </s>
<s> It has accustomed us to such news as that in Illinois there are fiftyeight public high schools in which instruction is offered in one or more of the three following subjects Food Clothing or The Home </s>
<s> It has brought us to the point of expecting domestic science in all schools of agriculture and of regarding it as natural for the legislature of Montana to appropriate 50000 to the State Agricultural College for a woman's dormitory </s>
<s> It has cushioned the shock of the tidings from the University of California to the effect that entrance credit will this fall be given for high school domestic science work </s>
<s> We are reduced to equanimity in the face of the fact which might have frenzied Alexander Hamilton that Columbia University through its Teachers College is offering courses in Elementary Cookery in Shirtwaists in Domestic Laundering and in Housewifery </s>
<s> And at last when we see the resuscitated home making its way even into the reallytruly morethanmasculinely academic Eastern women's colleges we rush up to the Mike McCarthy of this case and assure him warmly that we were not deceived for a moment by his apparent demise having just learned that President Hazard of Wellesley College in her latest commencement address said I hope the time may soon come when we can have a department of domestic science which shall give a sound basis for the problems of the household What does it all mean </s>
<s> FellowCitizens said the colored orator reported by Dr. Paul Monroe of Columbia what am education </s>
<s> Education am the palladium of our liberties and the grand pandemonium of civilization </s>
<s> But it does mean something this Home Economics disturbance </s>
<s> AND SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT SEEMS TO </s>
<s> II Mr. Edward T </s>
<s> Devine </s>
<s> of the New York Charity Organization Society has distinguished himself in the field of economic thought as well as in the field of active social reform </s>
<s> Among his works is a minute but momentous treatise on The Economic Function of Women </s>
<s> It is really a plea for the proposition that today the art of consuming wealth is just as important a study as the art of producing it </s>
<s> If acquisition says Mr. Devine has been the idea which in the past history of economics has been unduly emphasized expenditure is the idea which the future history of the science will place beside it </s>
<s> We have used our brains while getting hold of money </s>
<s> We are going to use our brains while getting rid of it </s>
<s> We have studied banking engineering shop practice cost systems salesmanship </s>
<s> We are going to study food values the hygiene of clothing the sanitary construction and operation of living quarters the mental reaction of amusements the distribution of income the art of making choices according to our means from among the millions of things harmful and helpful ugly and beautiful offered to us by the producing world </s>
<s> Mr. Devine ventures to hope that we may look for a radical improvement in general economic conditions from a wiser use of the wealth which we have chosen to produce </s>
<s> This enlarged view of the economic importance of Consumption brings with it a correspondingly enlarged view of the economic importance of the Home </s>
<s> If the Factory says Mr. Devine has been the center of the economics which has had to do with production the Home will displace the Factory as the center of interest in a system which gives due prominence to Enjoyment and Use </s>
<s> There will result continues Mr. Devine an increased respect on the part of economists for the industrial function which woman performs for there is no economic function higher than that of determining how wealth shall be used so that even if man remain the chief producer of wealth and woman remain the chief factor in determining how wealth shall be used the economic position of woman will not be considered by those who judge with discrimination to be inferior to that of man </s>
<s> Mr. Devine then lays out for the economist a task in the discharge of which the innocent bystander will sincerely wish him a pleasant trip and a safe return </s>
<s> It is the present duty of the economist says Mr. Devine to accompany the wealth expender to the very threshold of the home that he may point out with untiring vigilance its emptiness caused not so much by lack of income as by lack of knowledge of how to spend wisely </s>
<s> Mr. Deville's proposition therefore would seem finally to sanction some such conclusion as this Physical science and social science and common sense are making such important contributions to the subject of the rearing of children and to the subject of the maintenance of wholesome and beautiful living conditions and to the subject of the use of leisure that while the home woman has lost almost all of the productive industries which she once controlled she has simultaneously gained a whole new field of labor </s>
<s> Consumption has ceased to be merely PASSIVE and has become ACTIVE </s>
<s> It has ceased to be mere ABSORPTION and has become CHOICE </s>
<s> And the active choosing of the products of the world both spiritual and material in connection with her children her house and her spare time has developed for the home woman into a task so broad into an art so difficult as to require serious study </s>
<s> We have quoted at length from Mr. Devine's discourse because it is recognized as the classic statement of the case and because it is warmly commended by such women as Mrs. Ellen H </s>
<s> Richards of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose skill as scientist and vision as philosopher have made her the most authoritative personality in the American Home Economics Association </s>
<s> That association by the way has some fifteen hundred duepaying members </s>
<s> The scales fall from our eyes now and we see at least one thing which we had not seen before </s>
<s> We had supposed that sewing and cooking were the vitals of the Home Economics movement </s>
<s> Not at all </s>
<s> The home woman might cease altogether to sew and to cook just as she has ceased altogether to spin weave brew etc </s>
<s> without depriving the Home Economics movement of any considerable part of its driving power </s>
<s> Sewing and cooking are productive processes </s>
<s> They add economic value to certain commodities namely cloth and food </s>
<s> But it is not Production it is Consumption which the Home Economics movement is at heart devoted to </s>
<s> This is plainly set forth by some of its most zealous workers </s>
<s> Thus Edna D </s>
<s> Day at the Lake Placid Conference on Home Economics in 1908 was more or less sorry that domestic science has come to be so largely sewing and cooking in our schools was quite willing to look at the white of the eye of the fact that more and more we are buying readymade clothes and readycooked foods and marked out the policy of her Survey Course in Home Economics at the University of Missouri in the statement that sewing and cooking are decreasingly home problems while the problems of wise buying of adjusting standards of living to income and of developing right feelings in regard to family responsibilities are increasingly difficult </s>
<s> To choose and use the world's resources intelligently on behalf of family and communityin this Mr. Devine sees a new field of action in this Mrs. Richards sees a new field of education </s>
<s> Women will train themselves for their duties as consumers or else continue to lie under the sentence of condemnation pronounced upon them by Florence Nightingale </s>
<s> Threefourths of the mischief in women's lives said she arises from their excepting themselves from the rule of training considered necessary for men </s>
<s> But what in this case is the training proposed </s>
<s> The answer to that question will cause some more scales to fall from our eyes </s>
<s> Just as we have seen that Home Economics does not consist essentially of sewing and cooking we shall see that Consumption is not at all a specialized technique in the sense in which electrical engineering department store buying railroading cotton manufacturing medicine and the other occupations of the outside world are specialized technigues </s>
<s> Home Economics will not narrow women's education but in the end will enlarge it because Consumption instead of being a specialty is a generality so broad as almost to glitter </s>
<s> III AT Menomonie Wisconsin Mr. L </s>
<s> D </s>
<s> Harvey lately president of the National Education Association has established a Homemakers' School </s>
<s> It does not turn out teachers </s>
<s> Its course of instruction is solely for the prospective housewife </s>
<s> The first grand division of study is The House </s>
<s> We here observe that the housewife is going to be something of a Sanitary Engineer since she studies Chemistry Physics and Bacteriology in their application to such subjects as the heating lighting ventilation and plumbing of a house </s>
<s> It is thought that knowledge of this sort will go a long way toward improving the health conditions of the country </s>
<s> We also observe that the housewife is going to be something of an Interior Decorator since she studies design color house planning and furnishing </s>
<s> She also acquires some skill as Purchasing Agent Bookkeeper and Employer of Labor when she takes the course on Household Management and studies the proper apportioning of income among the different lines of home expenditures the systematizing and keeping of household accounts and the question of domestic service </s>
<s> The second grand division is Food Study and Preparation </s>
<s> Here the housewife becomes to some extent a Dietitian studying the chemical processes in the preparation and digestion of foods and considering the question how she shall secure for the family the foods best suited to the various activities of each individual </s>
<s> Here likewise she makes a start toward being a Pure Food Expert through a study of physical and chemical changes induced in food products by the growth of molds yeasts and bacteria and a start toward being a Health Officer through a study of bacteria in their relation to disease sources of infection personal and household disinfection </s>
<s> Nor does she omit to acquire some of the technique of the Physical Director through a course in Physiology bearing on digestion storage of energy rest sleep exercise and regularity of habits </s>
<s> Of course in her work in cookery she pays some attention to special cookery for invalids </s>
<s> The third grand division that of Clothing and Household Fabrics produces a Dressmaker a Milliner and an Embroiderer as well as a person trained to see to it that the expenditure for clothing shall be correct in proportion to the expenditure for other purposes </s>
<s> The fourth grand division the Care of Children is of course limitless </s>
<s> The rearing of the human young is as we all know and as Mr. Eliot of Harvard has insisted the most intellectual occupation in the world </s>
<s> Here the homemaker applies all the knowledge she has gained from her study of the hygiene of foods and of the hygiene of clothes and also makes some progress toward becoming a Trained Nurse and a Kindergartner by means of researches into infant diseases and emergencies the stages of the mental development of the child the child's imagination with regard to truthtelling and deceit the history of children's books and the art of storytelling </s>
<s> Passing over the fifth grand division Home Nursing and Emergencies in which the pupil learns simply the use of household remedies the care of the sickroom etc </s>
<s> we come to the wide expanse of the sixth grand division Home and Social Economics </s>
<s> The work in this division begins with a study of the primitive evolution of the home and comes on down to the present time when the passing of many of the former lines of woman's work into the factory has brought to many women leisure time which should be spent in social service </s>
<s> Note that last fact carefully </s>
<s> Home Economics is no attempt to drive women back into home seclusion </s>
<s> On the contrary it is an attempt to bring the home and its occupants into the scientific and sociological developments of the outside world </s>
<s> For this reason in traversing the division of Home and Social Economics the pupil encounters an attempt to determine problems in civic life which seem to be a part of the duties of women </s>
<s> Seventhly and lastly there is a division dedicated to Literature in which a systematic course in reading is carried on through the two years </s>
<s> Indispensable </s>
<s> No degree of proficiency at inserting calories in correct numbers in to Little Sally's stomach could atone for lack of skill at leading Little Sally herself in morning strolls through the Child's Garden of Verses with trowel in hand to dig up the gayest plants and reset them in the memory </s>
<s> Which brings us back to the observation that the Consumption of Wealth is a generality </s>
<s> The homemaker may happen to be a specialist in some one direction but it is clear that she cannot simultaneously know as much about food values as the real dietitian as much about the physical care of her child as the real trained nurse as much about the wholesomeness of her living arrangements as the real sanitarian as much about music as the Thomas Orchestra as much about social service as Mr. Devine and as much about poems as Mr. Stevenson </s>
<s> Her peculiar equipment if she is a good homemaker is a round of experience and a bent of mind which make it possible for her to cooperate intelligently with the dietitian the trained nurse the sanitarian the Thomas Orchestra Mr. Devine Mr. Stevenson and the various other representatives of the various other specialized techniques of the outside world </s>
<s> It follows that her school discipline cannot be too comprehensive </s>
<s> No other occupation demands such breadth of sense and sensibility </s>
<s> One could make a perfectly good cotton manufacturer on the basis of a very narrow training </s>
<s> One cannot make a good consumer without a really LIBERAL EDUCATION </s>
<s> For this reason it becomes necessary to resist certain narrownesses in certain phases of Home Economics </s>
<s> One of these narrownesses is the assumption that because a thing happens to be close to us it is therefore important </s>
<s> We have heard lecturers insist that because a house contains drainpipes a woman should learn all about drainpipes </s>
<s> But why </s>
<s> In most communities drainpipes are installed and repaired and in every way controlled by gentlemen who are drainpipe specialists </s>
<s> The woman who lives in the house has no more real need of a knowledge of the structural mysteries of drainpipes than a reporter has of a knowledge of the structural mysteries of his typewriting machine </s>
<s> The office mechanic fixes all that for him and so far as his efficiency as a reporter is concerned an investigation of his faithful keyboard's internal arrangements would be in most cases an amiable waste of time </s>
<s> Another possible narrowness is the attempt to manufacture cultural backgrounds for various important but quite safeandsane household tasks </s>
<s> For instance in the books and in the courses of instruction of college grade on The House we have sometimes observed elaborate accounts of the evolution of the human home beginning with the huts of the primitive Simianians </s>
<s> And in pursuing the very essential subject of Clothes and Fabrics we have not infrequently found ourselves in the midst of spacious preliminary dissertations on the structure of the loom beginning with that which was used by the Anthropenguins </s>
<s> Now we would not for the world speak disparagingly of looms or huts </s>
<s> We have ourselves examined some of them in the Hull House Museum in Chicago and in the woods of Canada and have found them instructive </s>
<s> We suggest only that college life is short that the college curriculum is crowded and that except possibly for those students who are especially interested in anthropology or in industrial evolution it would surely be a misfortune to learn the Simianian hut and to miss Rossetti's House of Life or to get the impression that as a cultural background for shirtwaists the Anthropengruinian loom can really compete with Carlyle's Sartor Resartus </s>
<s> If this occasional tendency toward exaggerating the importance of drainpipes windowcurtains and doormats were to grow strong and if girls as a class should be required to spend any large proportion of their time on the specialized history and sociology of feminine implements and tasks while the boys were still in the current of the affairs of the race we should indeed want President Thomas of Bryn Mawr to repeat on a thousand lecture platforms her indignant assertion of the fact that nothing more disastrous for women or for men can be conceived of than specialized education of women as a sex </s>
<s> These parenthetical observations however amount simply to the expression of our personal opinion that Home Economics like every new idea carries with it large quantities of dross which will have to be refined out in the smelter of trial </s>
<s> The real metal in it is its attempt to establish the principle that intelligent Consumption is an important and difficult task </s>
<s> For that reason it will not only desire but demand the utmost equality of educational opportunity </s>
<s> And women like men will continue to get their cultural backgrounds in the great achievements of the whole race where they can hold converse with Lincoln and Darwin and the makers of the Cologne Cathedral and George Meredith and Pasteur and Karl Marx and Whistler and Joan of Arc and St. John </s>
<s> The woman voiced a great truth who said that the soul which can irradiate the numberless pettinesses of home management and it is folly to deny that there ARE numberless pettinesses in it is the soul nourished elsewhere </s>
<s> Think it over </s>
<s> It tells the story </s>
<s> Whether that elsewhere is the deep recesses of her own religious nature or the wide stretches of the great arts and sciences it is always an elsewhere </s>
<s> Let that be granted as it must be granted </s>
<s> Let us say that there shall be no abridgment of the offerings of socalled academic education </s>
<s> What does a course of study like that of Mr. Harvey's Homemakers' School attempt to add to academic education </s>
<s> Principally three things </s>
<s> First Certain manual arts </s>
<s> Second Certain domestic applications of the physical and sociological sciences </s>
<s> Third Money Sense in Expenditure in the course on Household Management </s>
<s> The last of these three things is appearing in many places </s>
<s> At the University of Illinois for instance Professor Kinley now delegate from the United States to the PanAmerican Congress has given courses in Home Administration for women which he has regarded as of equal importance with his courses in Business Administration for men </s>
<s> At the University of Chicago in the Department of Household Administration Course 44 is on The Administration of the House and includes the proper apportionment of income </s>
<s> The business man says My sales cost or my manufacturing cost or my officeforce cost is such and such a per cent </s>
<s> of my total cost </s>
<s> When it goes above that I want to know why and I find out and if there isn't a mighty good reason for its going up I make it go down again to where it was </s>
<s> Shall we come to the day when in spending the money which has been earned in business we shall say Such and such a per cent </s>
<s> to food and such and such a per cent </s>
<s> to clothes and such and such a per cent </s>
<s> to shelter and such and such a per cent </s>
<s> to health and recreation and such and such a per cent </s>
<s> to good works and such and such other per cents </s>
<s> to various other purposes </s>
<s> Shall we come to the day when we shall consume wealth with as much forethought and with as much balance of judgment between conflicting claims as we now exhibit in acquiring wealth </s>
<s> They are trying to develop this Costs System for Home Expenditures in many of the schools and departments of Home Economics today </s>
<s> They believe that most people because of not looking ahead and because of not making definite plans based on previous experience come to the contemplation of their bills on the first of each month with every reason to confess that they have bought those things which they ought not to have bought and have left unbought those things which they ought to have bought </s>
<s> But it is not only a matter of reaching a systematic instead of a helterskelter enjoyment of the offerings of the world </s>
<s> It is also a matter of reaching by study of money values a mental habit of economy </s>
<s> And it comes at a time when that habit is needed </s>
<s> We are just beginning to realize in the United States that we cannot spend all our annual earnings on living expenses and still have a surplus for fresh capital for new industrial enterprises </s>
<s> We are on the point of perceiving that we are cramping and stunting the future industrial expansion of the country by our personal extravagance </s>
<s> We shall soon really believe Mr. James J </s>
<s> Hill when he says that every dollar unprofitably spent is a crime against posterity </s>
<s> When international industrial competition reaches its climax that nation will have an advantage whose people feel most keenly that the wise expenditure of income is a patriotic as well as a personal duty </s>
<s> But is this a matter for women alone </s>
<s> Do not men also consume </s>
<s> Are there no vats in Milwaukee no stills in Kentucky no factories wrapping paperrings around bunches of dead leaves at Tampa </s>
<s> Are there no men's tailors gents' furnishing shops luncheons clubs banquets athletics celebrations </s>
<s> And as for home expenditures themselves is the man simply to bring the plunder to the door get patted on the head and trot off in search of more plunder </s>
<s> We must doubt if economy will be reached by such a route </s>
<s> We find ourselves agreeing rather with the Home Economics lecturer who said There never yet was a family income really wisely expended without cooperation in all matters between husband and wife </s>
<s> The Massachusetts legislature has passed a law looking toward the teaching of Thrift in the public schools </s>
<s> Boys and girls need it equally </s>
<s> And we venture to surmise that in so far as the new art and science of Consumption is concerned with wise spending the bulk of its teachings ultimately will be enjoyed by both sexes </s>
<s> It will not be to any great extent a specialized education for women </s>
<s> So much for the Money Sense in Expenditure which a full Home Economics course adds to academic education </s>
<s> The more we admit its value the more convinced we must be that it ought to include every kind of expenditure and both kinds of human being </s>
<s> A precisely similar conviction arises with regard to those domestic applications of the physical and sociological sciences which a full Home Economics course adds to an academic education </s>
<s> Those domestic applications are most of them broadly human applications </s>
<s> They bear on daily living exercise fresh air personal cleanliness diet sleep the avoidance of contagion methods of fighting off disease general physical efficiency </s>
<s> They all amount to what Mrs. Ellen H </s>
<s> Richards calls Right Living </s>
<s> She would have four R's instead of three Reading Riting Rithmetic and Right Living </s>
<s> Now is Right Living to be only for girls </s>
<s> Mr. Eliot of Harvard does not think so </s>
<s> In a recent Survey of the Needs of Education he said Public instruction in preventive medicine must be provided for all children and the hygienic method of living must be taught in all schools </s>
<s> . . . To make this new knowledge and skill a universal subject of instruction in our schools colleges and universities is by no means impossibleindeed it would not even be difficult for it is a subject full of natural history as well as social interest </s>
<s> . . . American schools of every sort ought to provide systematic instruction on public and private hygiene diet sex hygiene and the prevention of disease and premature death not only because these subjects profoundly affect human affections and public happiness but because they are of high economic importance </s>
<s> A large part of Home Economics is simply Living Conditions </s>
<s> It is simply the lessons of Bacteriology Chemistry Physiology and Sociology about the common facts of daily physical and social existence </s>
<s> It may very well be therefore that what Mr. Eliot had in mind will not only come to pass but will even exceed his expectations </s>
<s> It may very well be that the educational policy of the future was correctly searchlighted by Miss Henrietta I </s>
<s> Goodrich who used to direct the Boston School of Housekeeping before it was merged into Simmons College when she said We need to have courage to break the present courses in household arts and domestic science into their component parts and begin again on the much broader basis of a study of living conditions </s>
<s> Our plea would be this that instruction in the facts of daily living be incorporated in the state's educational system from the primary grades through the graduate departments of the universities with a rank equal to that of any subject that is taught AS REQUIRED WORK FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS </s>
<s> We revert now finally to the manual arts which a full course in Home Economics adds to an academic education </s>
<s> In this matter just as in the matter of Money Sense in Expenditure and in the matter of Right Living we observe that the ultimate issue of the movement is not so much a specialized education for women as a practical efficiency in the common things of life for men and women both </s>
<s> A reasonable proficiency in manual arts will some day be the heritage of all educated people </s>
<s> Mr. Eliot in his Survey of the Needs of Education speaks appreciatingly of his father's having caused him to learn carpentry and woodturning </s>
<s> He goes on to say This I hold to be the great need of education in the United Statesthe devoting of a much larger proportion of the total school time to the training of the eye ear and hand </s>
<s> It follows then that cooking and sewing for girls in the elementary schools must be made just as rigorous a discipline for eye and hand as woodworking is for boys </s>
<s> It even follows that boys and girls will often get their manual training together </s>
<s> It will not be a case of household drudgery for the girls while the boys are studying civics </s>
<s> Somewhere in this article and as close to this paragraph as we can get the Art Director to put it the reader will find a picture of the living room of the model house of the WashingtonAllston Elementary School in Boston </s>
<s> The boys and girls of graduating grade in that school give four hours a week to matters connected with the welfare of that house </s>
<s> They have furnished it throughout with their own handiwork the girls making pillowcases wallcoverings windowcurtains etc </s>
<s> and the boys making chairs tables cupboards etc </s>
<s> Succeeding classes will furnish it again </s>
<s> THE REASON WHY MR. CRAWFORD THE MASTER OF THE SCHOOL CHOSE TO HAVE A HOUSE FOR A MANUAL TRAINING LABORATORY WAS SIMPLY THAT A HOUSE OFFERS AMPLER OPPORTUNITIES THAN ANY OTHER KIND OF PLACE FOR INSTRUCTION IN THE PRACTICAL EFFICIENCIES OF DAILY LIVING FOR BOTH SEXES </s>
<s> The system will be complete when the girls get a bigger training in design by making more of the chairs and when the boys get a bigger training in diet by doing more of the cooking </s>
<s> IV LAST month's article ended with the inquiry whether the new education for homemaking would clash seriously with the modern young woman's necessary education for moneyearning </s>
<s> We conclude that it will not </s>
<s> Such developments as the long specialized fouryear course in Household Economics at Simmons College in Boston are not here in point </s>
<s> That Simmons course is more than an education for homemaking </s>
<s> It is an education for earning money by teaching homemaking or by becoming among other things a dietitian in a hospital or a manager of a lunchroom or an interior decorator </s>
<s> Our subject is not Home Economics as a moneyearning occupation for a few women but Home Economics as part of the education of all women </s>
<s> In that aspect it does not seem likely to result in any special feminine education of such bulk as to withdraw women in any serious degree from the general education of the race </s>
<s> This is undeniably true provided our observations have been correct that 1 </s>
<s> Home Economics is at heart Consumption and must be so because the home woman is more and more purely a consumer </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> Consumption is the broadest of generalities requiring the broadest of liberal educations </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> So far as manual arts are concerned the nonacademic cookery of the girl is balanced by the nonacademic carpentry of the boy </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> Right Living and Wise Spending will to a great extent get diffused throughout the whole educational system for boys and girls men and women alike </s>
<s> If there remains and there does remain certain further specialization which the average girl needs in order to be a good wife mother and homemaker she will get it in finishing courses furnished at the various levels of the educational system when she leaves school or else better still she will get it in continuation schools for adults to which she may resort when she is actually going to be a wife mother or homemaker </s>
<s> Why learn really technical specialized things years and years before they are needed </s>
<s> Why learn them at a time when it is not certain that they will be needed at all </s>
<s> The modern postponement of marriage is here a controlling element </s>
<s> The fact that in Boston among women from thirty to thirtyfour years of age 297 out of every 1000 more than a quarter are still unmarried is usually put down to a scarcity of men </s>
<s> That scarcity is exaggerated </s>
<s> Observe the comparative numbers of unmarried women and of unmarried men in that ageperiod in Boston Unmarried Women 8081 Unmarried Men 10651 </s>
<s> Observe further The total number of men of all conjugal conditions in the ageperiod in question is 28603 </s>
<s> A little work with pencil and paper will now still further weaken the scarcity theory by revealing the fact that in Boston among men from thirty to thirtyfour years of age 372 out of every 1000 are still single </s>
<s> Social conditions in rural communities tend to approach those of urban communities </s>
<s> Social conditions in the West tend to approach those in the East </s>
<s> Boston is not eccentric </s>
<s> It is only ahead </s>
<s> Continuation School instruction in Home Economics for engaged and married women is a form of education beginning to appear in every part of the world </s>
<s> But it lies beyond the woman's period of moneyearning </s>
<s> How long is that period </s>
<s> And what are the social and racial consequences of the fact that speaking generally the more highly prepared modern men and women are to transmit intelligence to posterity the more steadily do they tend to give their most vigorous years to singleness </s>

<s> By WILLIAM HARD III LOVE DEFERRED Mary felt she would wait for John even if instead of going away on a career he were going away on a comet </s>
<s> She waited for him from the time she was twentytwo to the time she was twentysix and would have waited longer if she hadn't got angry and insisted on marrying him </s>
<s> Into why she waited and why she wouldn't wait any longer chance put most of the simple plot of the commonplace modern drama Love Deferred </s>
<s> It is so commonplace that it is doubtful if any other drama can so stretch the nerves or can so draw from them a thin high note of fine pain </s>
<s> We will pretend that John was a doctor </s>
<s> No that's too professional </s>
<s> He was a civil engineer </s>
<s> That's professional enough and more commercial </s>
<s> It combines Technique and Business which are the two big elements in the life of Modern Man </s>
<s> When they got engaged Mary was through college but John had one more year to go in engineering school </s>
<s> How the preparation for life does lengthen itself out </s>
<s> When Judge Story was professor at Harvard in the thirties of the last century he put the law into his pupils' heads in eighteen months </s>
<s> The present professors require three years </s>
<s> In 1870 the Harvard Medical School made you attend classes for four months in each of three years </s>
<s> It now makes you do it for nine months in each of four years </s>
<s> As for engineering the University of Wisconsin gave John a chill by informing him in its catalogue that it is coming to be generally recognized that a fouryear technical course following the highschool course is not an adequate preparation for those who are to fill important positions and the University would urge all those who can afford the time to extend their studies over a period of five or six years </s>
<s> John compromised on five </s>
<s> This gave him a few Business courses in the College of Commerce in addition to his regular Technique courses in the College of Engineering </s>
<s> He was now a Bachelor of Science </s>
<s> He thereupon became an apprentice in the shops of one of the two biggest electrical firms in the United States </s>
<s> He inspected the assembling of machines before they were shipped and he overheard wisdom from foremen and superintendents </s>
<s> His salary was fifteen cents an hour </s>
<s> Since he worked about ten hours a day his total income was about forty dollars a month </s>
<s> At the end of the year he was raised to fifty </s>
<s> This was the normal raise for a Bachelor of Science </s>
<s> The graduates of Yale and Harvard in the bright colonial days of those institutions married almost immediately on graduation </s>
<s> John didn't </s>
<s> He didn't get married so early nor become a widower so often </s>
<s> He didn't carry so many children to the christening font nor so many to the cemetery </s>
<s> Look at the dark as well as the bright side of colonial days </s>
<s> Pick out any of the early Harvard classes </s>
<s> Honestly and truly at random run your finger down the column and pick any class </s>
<s> The class of 1671 </s>
<s> It had eleven graduates </s>
<s> One of them remained a bachelor </s>
<s> Don't be too severe on him </s>
<s> He died at twentyfour </s>
<s> Of the remaining ten four were married twice and two were married three times </s>
<s> For ten husbands therefore there were eighteen wives </s>
<s> Mr. G </s>
<s> Stanley Hall President of Clark University very competently remarks The problem of superfluous women did not exist in those days </s>
<s> They were all needed to bring up another woman's children </s>
<s> The ten husbands of the Harvard class of 1671 with their eighteen wives had seventyone children </s>
<s> They did replenish the earth </s>
<s> They also filled the churchyards </s>
<s> TWENTYONE OF THOSE SEVENTYONE CHILDREN DIED IN CHILDHOOD </s>
<s> This left fifty to grow up </s>
<s> It was an average of five surviving children for each of the ten fathers </s>
<s> But it was an average of only 2.7 for each of the eighteen mothers </s>
<s> In commending the colonial family one must make an offset for the unfair frequency with which it had more than one wifeandmother to help out its fertility record </s>
<s> And in commending the era of young wives and numerous children one must make an offset for the hideous frequency with which it killed them </s>
<s> Turn from Harvard to Yale </s>
<s> Look at the men who graduated from 1701 to 1745 </s>
<s> The girls they took in marriage were most of them under twentyone and were many of them down in their 'teens sometimes as far down as fourteen </s>
<s> May we observe that they were not taken in marriage out of a conscious sense of duty to the Commonwealth and to Population </s>
<s> They were taken because they were needed </s>
<s> The colonial gentleman had to have his soapkettles and candlemolds and looms and smokehouses and saltingtubs and spinningwheels and other industrial machines operated for him by somebody if he was going to get his food and clothes and other necessaries cheap </s>
<s> He lost money if he wasn't domestic </s>
<s> He was domestic </s>
<s> Our young engineering friend John when HE looked forward to HIS future domestic establishment saw no industrial machines in it at all except a needle and a saucepan </s>
<s> Consequently he had very little real use for a wife </s>
<s> What he wanted was money enough to give Mary a home </s>
<s> Marriages are more uncertain now </s>
<s> And fewer of them are marriages of mere convenience </s>
<s> It is both a worse and a better state of things </s>
<s> On the one hand John didn't marry Mary so soon </s>
<s> On the other hand he was prevented from wanting anything in his marriage except just Mary </s>
<s> The enormous utility of the colonial wife issuing in enormous toil complicated by unlimited childbearing had this kind of result Among the wives of the 418 Yale husbands of the period from 1701 to 1745 there were Thirtythree who died before they were twentyfive years old Fiftyfive who died before they were thirtyfive years old Fiftynine who died before they were fortyfive years old </s>
<s> Those 418 Yale husbands lost 147 wives before full middle age </s>
<s> It ceases therefore to be surprising though it remains unabatedly sickening that the stories of the careers of colonial college men of the bestbred men of the times are filled with such details as First wife died at twentyfour leaving six children </s>
<s> Eight children born within twelve years two of them feebleminded </s>
<s> First wife died at nineteen leaving three children </s>
<s> Fourteen children </s>
<s> First wife died at twentyeight having borne eight children in ten years </s>
<s> From that age of universal early marrying and of promiscuous early dying we have come in two centuries to an age of delayed and even omitted marrying and of a settled determination to keep on living </s>
<s> The women's colleges are so new and they attracted in their early days so unaverage a sort of girl that their records are not conclusive </s>
<s> Nevertheless here are some guiding facts from Smith College of Northampton Massachusetts We are taking college facts not because this article is confined in any respect to college people but merely because the matrimonial histories in the records of the colleges are the most complete we know of </s>
<s> In 1888 Smith College in its first ten classes had graduated 370 women </s>
<s> In 1903 fifteen years later among those 370 women there were 212 who were still single </s>
<s> This record does not satisfy Mr. G </s>
<s> Stanley Hall who figured it out </s>
<s> The remaining facts however might be considered more cheering The 158 Smith women who had married had borne 315 children </s>
<s> This was two for each of them </s>
<s> And most of them were still in their childbearing period </s>
<s> Compare this with the colonial records </s>
<s> But don't take the number of children per colonial father </s>
<s> Be fair </s>
<s> Take it per mother </s>
<s> We have the matrimonial histories of colonial Yale and Harvard men grouped and averaged according to the decade in which they graduated </s>
<s> We will regard the graduates of each decade as together constituting one case </s>
<s> In no case does the average number of children per wife go higher than 3.89 </s>
<s> In one case it goes as low as 2.98 </s>
<s> Perhaps the modern wife's habit of going on living and thereby protracting her period of childbearing will in time cause her fertility record to compare not unfavorably with that of the colonial wife who made an early start but a quick finish </s>
<s> In the year 1903 among all the 370 Smith graduates in those first ten classes only twentyfour had died </s>
<s> And among all the 315 children only twentysix had died </s>
<s> On the whole between being the wife of a Yale or Harvard colonial graduate and being a member of one of the first ten Smith classes a modern girl might conclude that the chances of being a dead one matrimonially in the latter case would be more than offset by the chances of being a dead one actually in the former </s>
<s> This deplorable flippancy would overlook the serious fact that permanent or even prolonged celibacy on the part of large numbers of young men and young women is a great social evil </s>
<s> The consequences of that evil we shall observe later on.[1] [1] In speaking about celibacy we refer wholly to secular and not at all to religious celibacy </s>
<s> In the meantime we return to John and Mary </s>
<s> While John was doing his last year in engineering school Mary did a year of technical study in the New York School of Philanthropy or in the St. Louis School of Social Economy or in the Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy or in the Boston School for Social Workers </s>
<s> They won't even let you start in doing good nowadays without some training for it </s>
<s> This is wise considering how much harm doing good can do </s>
<s> But how the preparation for life does lengthen itself out </s>
<s> Mary took a civil service examination and got a job with the State Bureau of Labor </s>
<s> She finished her first year with the Bureau at the same time when John finished his first year with the electrical firm </s>
<s> She had earned 600 </s>
<s> He had earned 480 </s>
<s> There were several hundred other apprentices in the shops along with John </s>
<s> When he thought of the next year's work at fifty a month and when he looked at the horde of competing Bachelors of Science in which he was pocketed he whitened a bit </s>
<s> I must get out of the ruck he said to himself </s>
<s> I must get a specialty </s>
<s> I must do some more preparing </s>
<s> He began to perceive how long it takes the modern man to grow up intellectually and financially </s>
<s> He began to perceive what a tedious road he must travel before he could arrive at maturityand Mary </s>
<s> But he had pluck </s>
<s> I'll really prepare he said and then I'll really make good </s>
<s> A western university offered a scholarship of 500 a year the holder of which would be free to devote himself to a certain specified technical subject </s>
<s> John tried for the scholarship and got it and spent a year chasing electrical currents from the time when they left the wheels of street cars to the time when they eventually sneaked back home again into the powerhouse after having sported clandestinely along gas mains and water pipes biting holes into them as they went </s>
<s> It was a good subject commercially </s>
<s> At the end of the year he was engaged as engineer by a streetcar company which was being sued by a gas company for allowing its current to eat the gas company's property </s>
<s> He was to have a salary of 1000 a year </s>
<s> He was going strong </s>
<s> One thousand dollars </s>
<s> Millions of married couples live on less than that </s>
<s> But John didn't even think of asking Mary to share it with him </s>
<s> Mary when married was to be supported in approximate accordance with the standards of the people John knew </s>
<s> Every John thinks that about it without really thinking about it at all </s>
<s> It's just in him </s>
<s> It bothered Mary </s>
<s> How much money would John want to spend on her before he would take her </s>
<s> It made her feel like a box of candy in a store window </s>
<s> Still a social standard is a fact </s>
<s> Just as much so as if it could be laid off with a tape </s>
<s> And there is sense in it </s>
<s> After all thought Mary if we had only 1000 a year we couldn't live where any of our friends do and John would be cut off from being on daily intimate terms with people who could help him and if we had childrenWell there you are </s>
<s> We surely couldn't give our children what our children ought to have </s>
<s> That settles it </s>
<s> The influence of social standards is greatly increased and complicated in a world in which women earn their living before marriage and have a chance to make social standards of their own in place of the ones they were born to </s>
<s> We here insert a few notes on cases which are not compositely imaginedlike Mary and Johnbut are individually though typically existent in real life in one of the large American cities RJ </s>
<s> Makes 6500 a year </s>
<s> Only man she was ever real sweet on was a teamster </s>
<s> When she was selling in the perfumes at five a week he used to take her to the picnics of the Social Dozen Pleasure Club </s>
<s> They would practice the Denver Lurch on Professor DeVere's dancing platform </s>
<s> At midnight he would give her a joyride home in his employer's delivery wagon </s>
<s> He still drives that wagon </s>
<s> She is in charge of suits and costumes and has several assistant buyers under her </s>
<s> She has bought a cottage for her father who is an ingrain weaver in a carpet factory </s>
<s> She wears a stickpin recently presented to her by her teamster </s>
<s> I like him all right is her notion about it but I ought to have took him ten years ago </s>
<s> Now he can't support me </s>

<s> Then they wouldn't be so ready to marry ANYBODY </s>
<s> Works in the cloak department </s>
<s> Is a star </s>
<s> Makes about eighteen dollars a week </s>
<s> Says that most of the men she knows who could support her would certainly get in a terrible row at home if they married a cloakdepartment girl </s>
<s> Families are stuck up </s>
<s> But I don't care let it run awhile </s>
<s> Tell you something </s>
<s> I was born in the steerage </s>
<s> I've been right where the money isn't </s>
<s> I'm not taking any chances on getting there again </s>
<s> Let Georgina do it </s>
<s> RB </s>
<s> Subbookkeeper </s>
<s> Seven dollars a week </s>
<s> Engaged to clerk who earns thirteen </s>
<s> Says Of course I'm not earning much but I'm living with my folks and when we're married I'll have to give up a lot of things </s>
<s> Kinda wish I hadn't got used even to the seven </s>
<s> This last case of the bookkeeper engaged to the clerk is the modern situation at its happiest normal </s>
<s> The modern marriage except among the rich is a contraction of resources </s>
<s> It is just the reverse in that respect of the colonial marriage </s>
<s> The colonial bride marrying into Industry brought her full economic value to her husband </s>
<s> The modern bride marrying out of Industry leaves most of her economic value behind </s>
<s> And the greater that value was the sharper is the shock of the contraction of resources </s>
<s> Of course the case of the departmentstore buyer and the teamster is irrelevantly extreme </s>
<s> But aren't there thousands and thousands of cases which while less advanced are pointed in the same direction </s>
<s> The more a woman earns the fewer become the men who can support her </s>
<s> How can the clerk support the cloak saleswoman who has had eighteen dollars a week of her own </s>
<s> How can the barber support the manicurist who has had twelve </s>
<s> The cloak saleswoman may talk flippantly about it but at heart isn't she seriously right </s>
<s> She has pulled herself up to a certain level </s>
<s> Except in response to a grande passion she will not again drop below it </s>
<s> She will bring up her children at a point as close to her present level as she can </s>
<s> That is instinct </s>
<s> Meanwhile she isn't married </s>
<s> But what can you do about it </s>
<s> She went to work like almost every other working woman because she had to </s>
<s> And you can't pass a law prohibiting her from earning more than five dollars a week </s>
<s> It's all economic thought Mary </s>
<s> Nothing else </s>
<s> She had much reason for thinking so </s>

<s> But isn't the real reason thisthat New York with its large cities is farther removed than Vermont with no large cities from the primitive industrial conditions of colonial times </s>

<s> But belong to the class of people that professional men come from Your age at marriage will be on the average twentysix </s>
<s> This difference exists also in the United States </s>
<s> It is in the direct line of social and economic development </s>

<s> It takes him longer to get through his educational infancylonger to arrive at his mental and financial maturity </s>
<s> The professional man's wife is a farther developed type than the miner's wife </s>
<s> She has much more economic value if she works before marriage and much LESS economic value in any case after marriage </s>
<s> Where these two lines of development male and female come to a meeting point where the man's infancy is longest and the woman's economic value as a wife is least there is necessarily altogether apart from personal preferences the greatest postponement of marriage </s>

<s> In Belgium for instance which is a most intensely industrialized country the average age of women at marriage is 28.19 </s>
<s> It is hard indeed to look at the advancing marriage age and to compare its varying rate of progress in different continents different countries different localities and different social circles without admitting that whatever whirling nebulous mists of personal preferences it may create and carry with it its nucleus is purely economic </s>

<s> Out of his two years' experience he had saved a few hundred dollars </s>
<s> No he hadn't </s>
<s> That isn't probable </s>
<s> The way he made his start into the next phase of his career was not by having any ready money </s>
<s> Having ready money is far from being characteristic of the young man of today </s>
<s> John opened his office as a consulting electrical engineer not on his own resources but as an agent for an electrical supply company </s>
<s> Being agent for that company assured him enough money to pay the office rent and stenographer </s>

<s> Whom he didn't have </s>
<s> But he started out to get them </s>
<s> He opened his office in the city in which Mary was </s>
<s> And then a strange but normal thing occurred </s>

<s> Mr. Lester F </s>
<s> Ward has learnedly and elaborately informed us that if we go back to the origin of life on this planet we shall find that the female was the only sex then existent being original life itself reproducing itself by division of itself and that the male was created as an afterthought of nature's for the purpose of introducing greater variation into the development of living things </s>
<s> The male to begin with had only one function </s>
<s> That was to be a male </s>
<s> He was purely a sexthing </s>
<s> Whether this biological theory stands or falls it is certain that it squares with the present character of the sexes </s>
<s> The sex which originated as a sexthing remains the more actively sexed </s>
<s> There was once a very good sociologist called Robert Louis Stevenson who made many researches into the psychology of the human race </s>
<s> While on his Inland Voyage he observed in this matter that it is no use for a man to take to the woods we know him Anthony tried the same thing long ago and had a pitiful time of it by all accounts </s>
<s> But there is this about some women that they suffice to themselves and can walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance of any trousered being </s>
<s> The celibate life is more possible for most of them by nature </s>
<s> If it were not for that fact the postponement of marriage would by this time have demolished the ethical code </s>
<s> Even as things stand Mary was quite willing to admit when she saw it that there are two kinds of women greatly increasing in modern days </s>
<s> Both have always existed but now they are increasing very rapidly and in parallel lines of corresponding development </s>
<s> In one column is the enormous army of young women who remain unmarried till twentyfive till thirty till thirtyfive </s>
<s> Even at that latter age and beyond it in a welldeveloped city like say Providence Rhode Island in the age period from thirtyfive to fortyfive twenty out of every hundred women are still single </s>
<s> In the other column is the enormous army of young women who outside of the marriage relation altogether lead a professional sex life venal furtive ignoble and debasing an army which has existed since the beginning of time but which every postponement of the age of marriage causes to increase in relative numbers and to gain new strength for poisoning the blood of life </s>
<s> Love denied at the front door flies in by the cellar window </s>
<s> Angel or bat it is always with us </s>
<s> Our only choice is between its guises </s>
<s> Mary looked at the army of women celibates in offices and in stores and in their apartments and in their boarding houses women celibates five and ten and fifteen and twenty years into the period when nature has by irrepealable edict ordained love </s>
<s> It was surely unnatural for the mass of them </s>
<s> They were not vowed nuns </s>
<s> They were not devoted to any Great Cause </s>
<s> They were just ordinary normal young women thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of them </s>
<s> Then on the other side Mary looked at the great army of women in the midnight restaurants in the streets in their segregated quarterswomen who however they may be sentimentalized about and however irresponsible they may be for their own condition are as a matter of fact ignorant stupid silly and dirty </s>
<s> Yet on them was squandered the emotional life of millions of young men </s>
<s> On the one sideintelligent capable effective young women leading lives of emotional sterility </s>
<s> On the other sideinferior women blasted and withered by their specialization in the emotional life of youth </s>
<s> The connection between postponement of marriage and irregularity of living will be admitted by everybody who is willing to face facts and who is optimist enough to believe that if instead of letting facts lie we face them and fight them we can make a better race </s>
<s> The great Russian scientist Metchnikoff successor to Pasteur in the Pasteur Institute mentions the postponement of marriage as one of the biological disharmonies of life </s>
<s> It is a disharmony that among highly civilized peoples marriage and REGLULAR unions are impossible at the RIGHT TIME </s>
<s> And Mr. A </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Johnson writing in the authoritative report of the Committee of Fifteen on the Social Evil notes the parallel increase of young unmarried men and of a city's volume of vice </s>
<s> He goes on to make without comment a statement of the economic facts of the case </s>
<s> As a rule he says the income which a young man earns while sufficient to secure a fair degree of comfort for himself does not suffice for founding a family </s>
<s> He cannot found a family at the right time </s>
<s> He goes unmarried through the romantic period of his development when the senses are at their keenest and when the other sex in its most vividly idealized perfection is most poignantly desired </s>
<s> Then later on he may begin to get a larger income </s>
<s> Then marriage may become more feasible </s>
<s> But then romance is waning </s>
<s> Then as Mr. Johnson says his standard of personal comfort rises </s>
<s> Romance has been succeeded by calculation </s>
<s> Accordingly he postpones marriage to a date in the indefinite future or abandons expectation of it altogether </s>
<s> Celibacy through the age of romance </s>
<s> It's emotionally wrong </s>
<s> Sexlessness for a score of years after sex has awakened </s>
<s> It's biologically wrong </s>
<s> It's a defiance of nature </s>
<s> And nature responds as she does to every defiance with a scourge of physical and social ills </s>
<s> But what of all that </s>
<s> thought Mary </s>
<s> Those things are just observations </s>
<s> What I am going to act on is that I want John </s>
<s> At which point she stopped being a typical modern young woman </s>
<s> SHE BECAME A WOMAN OF THE FUTURE </s>
<s> Look here she said to John I'm working </s>
<s> You're working </s>
<s> We're single </s>
<s> Very well </s>
<s> We'll change it </s>
<s> I'm working </s>
<s> You're working </s>
<s> We're married </s>
<s> Have we lost anything </s>
<s> And we've gained each other </s>
<s> Two years later she stopped working </s>
<s> In those two years she had helped John to start a home </s>
<s> She couldn't operate soapkettles and candlemolds and looms and smokehouses and saltingtubs and spinningwheels for him </s>
<s> But she brought him an equivalent of it in money </s>
<s> She earned from 900 to 1000 a year </s>
<s> Being married they were more thrifty </s>
<s> They saved a large part of her earnings </s>
<s> John was still spending a large part of his on extending his business on traveling on entertaining prospective clients on making acquaintances </s>
<s> Sometimes she had to contribute some of her own money to his expense accounts </s>
<s> That was the fortune of war </s>
<s> She helped him pursue success </s>
<s> I wouldn't give up the memory of these two years Mary used to say as she sat and stitched for her children for anything </s>
<s> I shared at least a part of my husband's youth </s>
<s> By sharing it she won a certain happiness otherwise unattainable </s>
<s> They had come to know each other and to help form each other's characters and to share each other's difficulties in the years when only there is real joy in the struggle of life </s>
<s> They had not postponed their love till with a settled income John could support her in comfort and they could look back like Browning's middleaged estranged lovers to say We have not sighed deep laughed free Starved feasted despairedbeen happy </s>
<s> It used to take two to start a home in colonial days Mary would say </s>
<s> I am really an oldfashioned woman </s>
<s> I helped to make this home </s>
<s> We had twelve hundred dollars in the bank when I stopped working and John was pretty well established </s>
<s> I don't regret it she went on still speaking as a woman of the future even for the children </s>
<s> Of course I do wish we had started earlier </s>
<s> But I would have wanted to wait a while for the children in any case </s>
<s> People risk too much when they start a family before they become sufficiently used to marriage and to each other to know that they can keep on loving each other and to know that they have in them through their mutual continued happiness the power to make a happy home a noble home for children to live in </s>
<s> As for the number of children she will havewe reserve that subject to a future article </s>
<s> We call attention here only to this That the facts which were cited from the Smith College records are harmonious with many other facts and records tending to show that the fertility of the modern wife has been considerably underrated just as the fertility of the colonial wife has been considerably exaggerated </s>
<s> And this That Mary got to her childbearing period sooner than she would have if she hadn't insisted on marrying John before he was ready to support her </s>
<s> Those two years would have been childless years in any case </s>
<s> But they would probably if it hadn't been for Mary's money have been lengthened into four or five </s>
<s> Of course later marriages in themselves tend to reduce the number of children </s>
<s> As to quality however the evidence is not clear </s>
<s> There is even some reason to think that a moderate postponement is conducive to an improvement in quality </s>
<s> Did you ever read Havelock Ellis's book called A Study of British Genius </s>
<s> He made a list of the most distinguished of Eminent British Persons and studied everything about them from their religious opinions to the color of their hair </s>
<s> In the matter of the age of their parents he finds that the average age of the father at the birth of the person of genius was thirtyseven years while the average of the mother was thirtyone </s>
<s> His conclusion is On the whole it would appear so far as the evidence goes that the fathers of our eminent persons have been predominantly middleaged and to a marked extent elderly at the time of the distinguished son's birth while the mothers have been predominantly at the period of greatest vigor and maturity and to a somewhat unusual extent elderly </s>
<s> There has been a notable deficiency of young fathers and still more notably of young mothers </s>
<s> And did you ever see the study which Mr. R </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Holway made for the Department of Education of Leland Stanford University on The Age of Parents Its Effects upon Children </s>
<s> His conclusions are In most physical qualities the children of mature parents tend to come out best </s>
<s> In mental ability the children of young parents show best at an early age but rapidly lose their precocity </s>
<s> The elder children who show best tend to be the children of mature and old parents </s>
<s> The children of elderly mothers show a tendency to superiority throughout </s>
<s> Mary did not know about all this but she had a very strong opinion to the effect that in so far as the quality of her children could be affected by their home training she was glad she had spent at least a few years earning her living </s>
<s> Every woman said Mary ought to have some little time for developing into an individual </s>
<s> Home won't do it altogether </s>
<s> Not nowadays </s>
<s> The colonial home did being part of the working world </s>
<s> But what is the modern home </s>
<s> It is a nest an eddy a shelf a nook </s>
<s> It's something apart from the world </s>
<s> If a woman is going to prepare her son for a knowledge of the real world if she's going to be able to give him a training which has in it an understanding and an appreciation of the real world if she's going to be able to educate him into real living she must nowadays and increasingly in the future have some experience of her own on her own account in the real world before she becomes a mother </s>
<s> There's no getting away from that </s>
<s> A reasonable postponement of motherhood till the future mother becomes a competent individual is a good thing </s>
<s> The trouble about that said John is that it makes you too independent of me </s>
<s> Your proposition is to start in and earn your living till you're pretty good at it </s>
<s> That is you wouldn't marry me till you were sure you could chuck me </s>
<s> How about that </s>
<s> Well it has that side </s>
<s> But it has its other side too </s>
<s> Isn't there after all something rather pleasant for John in knowing KNOWING that Mary isn't cleaving unto him simply because she can't shift for herself </s>
<s> Something exquisitely gratifying in being certain CERTAIN that it isn't just necessity that keeps her a home woman </s>
<s> If I were a man living in wedlock said Mary I should want the door of the cage always wide open with my mate fluttering straight by it every minute to still nestle by me </s>
<s> And I should want her wings to be strong and I should want her to know that if she went through the door she could fly </s>
<s> For keeping her said Mary I should want to trust to my own wings and not to bars </s>
<s> However said Mary going farther into the future the process isn't complete </s>
<s> Freedom is not yet completely acquired </s>
<s> Children </s>
<s> We want them </s>
<s> We must have them </s>
<s> Yet how often they tie us to unions which have come to be unholy vile full of all uncleanness </s>
<s> Women will never be completely free till besides being able to earn their bread when they are NOT bearing children they are relieved of dependence on the individual character of another human person while they ARE </s>
<s> Mr. H </s>
<s> G </s>
<s> Wells is clearly right about it </s>
<s> When women bear children they perform a service to the state </s>
<s> Children are important to the state </s>
<s> They are its future life </s>
<s> To leave them to the eccentricities of the economic fate of the father is ridiculous </s>
<s> The woman who is bringing up children should receive from the state the equivalent of her service in a regular income </s>
<s> Then and then only in the union of man and woman will love and money reach their right relationshiplove a necessity money a welcome romance </s>
<s> It's remote very remote said Mary </s>
<s> And we can't dream it out in detail </s>
<s> But when it comes it won't come out of personal sentiment </s>
<s> It will come because of being demanded by the economic welfare of the community </s>
<s> It will come because it is the best way to get serviceable children for the state </s>
<s> It will come because after all it is the final answer to the postponement of marriage </s>

<s> 4 The Poison Bugaboo pages 518525 By SAMUEL HOPKINS ADAMS AUTHOR OF THE GREAT AMERICAN FRAUD THE MYSTERY WITH STEWART EDWARD WHITE ETC </s>
<s> ROMANCE revels in the peril of the unknown </s>
<s> Lapped about with the armorplate of civilization the modern citizen muses relishingly like a child beguiling himself with ogre tales upon the terrors which lie just beyond his ken </s>
<s> To his mind A stone's throw out on either hand And all the world is wild and strange </s>
<s> Avid for sensation he peoples the remoteness of forest and mountain with malign and destructive creatures whence has grown up an extensive and astonishing literature of snake and insect poison lore </s>
<s> Deadly is the master word of the cult </s>
<s> The rattlesnake is deadly </s>
<s> The copperhead and moccasin are deadly </s>
<s> So is the wholly mythical puff adder </s>
<s> In hardly less degree is the tarantula deadly while varying lethal capacities are ascribed to the centipede the scorpion the kissingbug and sundry other forms of insect life </s>
<s> The whole matter is based upon the slenderest foundations </s>
<s> I don't mean by this that these illfamed species are wholly innocuous </s>
<s> It would be highly inadvisable to snatch a kiss from a copperhead or to stroke a tarantula's fur the wrong way </s>
<s> But one could do it and live to boast of the achievement </s>
<s> Pseudoscience to the contrary notwithstanding there is no living thing within the boundaries of the United States of America whose bite or sting is sure death or with one possible exception even probable death </s>
<s> There are five varieties of venomous serpents in this country three of them Crotalids and two belonging to the Elaps family </s>
<s> The Elaps are rather rare </s>
<s> The Crotalids rattlesnake moccasin and copperhead are common and of the widest geographical distribution </s>
<s> Yet on the basis of actual evidence the amazing fact stands out that only about eighty persons so far as is ascertainable have ever died from snake bite in the United States </s>
<s> Nowhere in the Civil War records does a death from this cause appear though hundreds of thousands of men were living on the country and at a time when the serpent clan was much more numerous than now </s>
<s> Estimates vary as to the proportion of deaths to bites </s>
<s> Prentiss Willson believes that something over ten per cent </s>
<s> of all persons bitten by venomous snakes in the United States die </s>
<s> As to how many of these succumb not to the venom but to the misdirected efforts of misguided friends at treatmentan extremely important differentiationhe lacks the data upon which to base a reckoning </s>
<s> S </s>
<s> Weir Mitchell's figures indicate 8.7 per cent </s>
<s> mortality for rattlesnake bite </s>
<s> This would make the venom about as dangerous as the toxin of typhoid fever which is not generally regarded as a necessarily deadly disease </s>
<s> Other writers go as high as fifteen per cent </s>
<s> for the rattlesnake and as low as one per cent </s>
<s> for the copperhead </s>
<s> All general estimates seem to me to leave one basic element out of considerationthe unnoted nonfatal snake bites </s>
<s> That a bite resulting in death will eventually get itself reported is reasonably certain </s>
<s> On the other hand I am satisfied from talking with plantation owners in the South with ranchmen in the West and with woodsmen and hunters all over the country that in the remoter regions many instances of poisoning by copperheads and the smaller rattlesnakes never attain the dignity of being listed so insignificant are they in their effects </s>
<s> Were all these to be recorded I believe that the mortality ratio would fall notably </s>
<s> Although I have been interested in the subject for many years I have never met a man who has seen a fatal case of snake bite </s>
<s> More than this my friend Mr. Stewart Edward White a noted hunter and explorer of untrodden ground in regions infested by reptiles has known of but one case terminating in death which he believes to be authentic </s>
<s> Dr. J </s>
<s> A </s>
<s> Mitchell of Victoria Texas one of the most experienced of field observers has never met with an instance of fatality from this cause </s>
<s> Dr. Mitchell believes that horses always and dogs almost always recover from rattlesnake bite </s>
<s> He confirms from observation the mysterious fact that hogs exhibit absolute immunity from the venom </s>
<s> WHISKY VS. SNAKEBITE Be it remembered always that death following snake bite is not necessarily the same thing as death from snake bite </s>
<s> Error in treatment plays no small part in vitiating the statistics </s>
<s> For error read whisky </s>
<s> Whoever is primarily responsible for the hoary superstition that liquor in huge doses is useful in snake poisoning has many a life to answer for </s>
<s> Apart from any adventitious aid whatsoever whether from a snake or any other source a whole bottle of raw whisky forced down the throat of a man unaccustomed to alcohol is pretty likely to kill him and is absolutely certain to cause grave poisoning </s>
<s> Add to this that it is given often in such a manner that the reaction from it comes contemporaneously with the heart collapse caused by the venom and a telling commentary upon the method is suggested </s>
<s> It is a question whether alcohol should ever be given in such cases without the advice of a physician </s>
<s> Certain it is that it should not be poured into the victim in quantities limited only by the flaskcontents of the bystanders </s>
<s> Several years ago I saw two interestingly contrasted cases of copperhead bite </s>
<s> The first patient was a powerful fullblooded temperate Irish daylaborer who while roadmending was bitten on the back of the hand between two fingers </s>
<s> His fellows hustled him off to a room over a neighboring saloon where they proceeded to administer the classic treatment </s>
<s> Before the doctor arrived they had introduced a quart and a half of whisky into a stomach unused to anything stronger than beer in small quantities </s>
<s> Six hours later when I saw the man through the wreckage of chairs tables and bedding four battered friends were trying to hold him down </s>
<s> They thought he was having convulsions from the snake venom </s>
<s> He wasn't </s>
<s> He was having delirium tremens from the whisky </s>
<s> His arm and shoulder were purple and swollen </s>
<s> Later he collapsed </s>
<s> Will he die </s>
<s> I asked the doctor </s>
<s> He won't die of the bite but I think he will of the whisky replied the disgusted practitioner </s>
<s> But he didn't </s>
<s> His splendid physique pulled him through </s>
<s> It was long however before he wholly recovered from the effects of the two poisons </s>
<s> This was in a Hudson River town </s>
<s> Only a few miles away a negro boy shortly after was struck by a copperhead on the bare leg </s>
<s> The wound was a deep doublefanged puncture </s>
<s> While the boy's father rushed for whisky his mother ran for the doctor </s>
<s> The doctor got there first </s>
<s> He opened up the wound and rubbed in permanganate of potash to oxidize the venom and destroy its toxic properties </s>
<s> When I talked with the boy two days later he was hobbling about on a crutch and the swelling had almost subsided </s>
<s> Setting the boy's lesser age and resistant power against the fact of the laborer's being bitten in a worse place for crotaline venom is much more effective in an upper limb or extremity than in a lower we have a fairly illustrative instance of the relative merits of alcoholic and nonalcoholic measures </s>
<s> WHEN RATTLESNAKES KILL Thirteen cases of death following rattlesnake and copperhead bite in which satisfactory clinical data were obtainable are given by Prentiss Willson </s>
<s> Of the victims five were young children one was a fourteenyearold boy one a chronic drunkard and one a leper who submitted to the stroke of a captive rattlesnake in the mad hope that it would cure his affliction </s>
<s> It didin twentyfour hours </s>
<s> Of the remaining five three were dosed with alcohol in large quantities </s>
<s> In several of the cases notably those of the children there seemed to be at least an even chance of recovery when the ligatures binding the affected limb were loosened to relieve the pain with quickly fatal results </s>
<s> Two of the fatalities were attributed not immediately to the venom but to the secondary bloodpoisoning this being the case with the only copperhead bite in the list </s>
<s> Death resulting typically from crotaline poisoning occurred in two instances one the fourteenyearold boy who was struck by a large rattlesnake and died in six hours despite skilled and prompt medical attendance the other a Dr. Post into whose veins it would appear the poison entered immediately since a jet of blood spurted from the wound inflicted by the captive rattlesnake </s>
<s> The man passed from great agony into coma from which he never rallied death ensuing in five hours after the bite </s>
<s> There is nothing in these data to indicate that a fullgrown man in normal health and with proper treatment will succumb to crotaline poisoning unless the venom enters a vein direct </s>
<s> In the matter of the comparative potency of snake poisons there are apparent contradictions </s>
<s> In the order of recorded fatalities the rattlesnake ranks easily first with the water moccasin a rather distant second and the copperhead a very poor third </s>
<s> Yet experiments upon animals indicate that moccasin venom is five times as powerful as rattlesnake though only three times as powerful as copperhead </s>
<s> Taking the cobra as the basis of estimate it requires only twice as much moccasin venom as it does cobra poison to kill a guinea pig whereas it requires six times as much copperhead and ten times as much rattlesnake virus </s>
<s> Why then is the rattler preeminent over its more virulent cousins </s>
<s> Probably for two reasonsthe greater amount of venom secreted and the superior power with which the rattler drives its fangs home </s>
<s> NO VIPERS IN THIS COUNTRY Fully as much terror attaches in the country districts to the puff adder or sand viper as to the rattlesnake or copperhead </s>
<s> This is a suggestive bit of superstition since there's no such thing as an adder or viper on the Western hemisphere and never has been one unless it came carefully pickled in a jar </s>
<s> What passes for the supposedly deadly reptile is the common hognosed or bull snake </s>
<s> It is about as dangerous as an infuriated rabbit </s>
<s> But it puts up one of the best bluffs known to natural history </s>
<s> When caught at its favorite occupation of basking in the open without convenient avenue of escape it flattens its head and strikes right and left blowing and hissing with an aspect much more terrifying than that of the truly venomous species </s>
<s> Then when the objects of its fury have taken to trees or adjacent fences it glides quietly away into the grass and effaces itself </s>
<s> Any one who has the nerve to look it between the eyes may uncover its pretense </s>
<s> For by this token may be known the real Crotalids from the mock a small but distinct pit between eye and nostril </s>
<s> Lacking this mark no ventral crawler in the land of the free need cause a flutter in the most timid breast with one notable exception </s>
<s> BEWARE THE ELAPS Shun as you would a rabid dog a pretty little redandblack banded serpent about as thick as your thumb </s>
<s> If any living creature whose habitat is the United States deserves the epithet deadly it is the Elaps </s>
<s> Two species are known the harlequin snake which ranges throughout the Gulf states to Texas and up the Mississippi River to Ohio and the Sonoran coral snake found in the Southwest only </s>
<s> By a strange perversion of facts while the harmless hognosed snake enjoys a repute of terror the Elaps most dangerous of all American reptiles is commonly regarded as harmless </s>
<s> Partly this is due to its slight and graceful prettiness partly to its innocentappearing head which shows no flattening the popularly understood mark of the venomous species and partly to its lethargic and peaceful disposition </s>
<s> Experimenters wishing to secure the venom of the Elaps often find it difficult to rouse the snake to striking wrath </s>
<s> Very few instances are known of Elaps bite but those few unquestionably set this ornamental creature in a class by itself among American Ophidia for results </s>
<s> Out of eight wellauthenticated cases of Elaps bite six of the victims died </s>
<s> This is believed to indicate a falsely large percentage however the scientific estimate of mortality being somewhere between twentyfive and fifty per cent </s>
<s> A government scientist tells me of a curious result from coralsnake bite which came under his notice </s>
<s> The victim who was handling the reptile preparatory to photographing it apparently overstepped the bounds of its habitual forbearance for it fastened upon his finger with such determination that it had to be pried off </s>
<s> The man soon became unconscious but rallied and after three days of dubious condition recovered </s>
<s> Every year since at about the anniversary of the bite an ulcer forms upon the finger and the nail sloughs off </s>
<s> I have heard of similar recurrent effects from crotaline poisoning but none scientifically attested as is this phenomenon </s>
<s> Before passing from the subject of snakes let me make one point clear </s>
<s> While the venomous snakes of this country are by no means deadly in the ordinary sense of the term their bite is always serious both in its immediate effects and in the possibility of after effects </s>
<s> The bitten person should get to a physician at once </s>
<s> The immediate treatment is prompt incision and sucking of the wound </s>
<s> Permanganate of potash for rubbing into the bitten place should always be carried by persons traveling in a snakeinfested country </s>
<s> If the bite is on a limb a light ligature will check the spread of the venom </s>
<s> Use whisky sparingly if at all and then only in case of complete collapse </s>
<s> The local treatments are most effective while the venom is still around the site of the bite and will reduce the injurious effects considerably </s>
<s> But after half an hour or so the absorption of the venom becomes more general and the local treatments ineffective </s>
<s> When the venom once enters into general circulation no chemicals or medication can neutralize its effects except a specific antivenin such as has been prepared by Dr. Noguchi at the Rockefeller Institute in New York </s>
<s> Antivenin is the only antidote that can counteract the action of venom anywhere in the body </s>
<s> It finds the venom wherever it is present and neutralizes it there without producing any ill effects on the system </s>
<s> GILA MONSTER NOT SO MONSTROUS Dissension and discussion have raged for years about the hideous head of the Gila monster </s>
<s> This great lizard of the Southwest has been pronounced absolutely deadly by one set of partisans and absolutely harmless by another </s>
<s> Somewhere between lies the truth </s>
<s> If any human being has actually been bitten by a heloderma the event has either escaped notice or has been so hedged about with obstructive legend as to have forfeited scientific credence </s>
<s> But the saurian itself has been studied and dissected and its venom has been analyzed </s>
<s> The venom is related to snake poison but is neither crotaline nor elapine </s>
<s> From animal experiments it is thought that it might be fatal to man under unfavorable conditions </s>
<s> There are no fangs proper </s>
<s> The poison gland is in the lower jaw instead of in the upper as in snakes and its product is projected through small ducts which open in the gums outside the teeth </s>
<s> The Gila monster has the grip of a bulldog </s>
<s> Torture will not loosen its hold once fastened on </s>
<s> It is through this intimate contact that the venom works into the wounds </s>
<s> Fortunately the lizard is slow to anger and prefers flight to battle so it is likely to be long before science has an opportunity of studying the effect of its envenomed jawclamp upon man </s>
<s> There are a few vaguely rumored reports of prospectors having perished in the desert of Gila monster poison but these are so confused with symptoms suspiciously resembling alcoholic poisoning as to lead Dr. R </s>
<s> W </s>
<s> Shufeldt an authority upon the Reptilia to remark that a quart of raw whisky practically given at one dose may prove more fatal than the bite of ten helodermas </s>
<s> Almost any kind of an insect bite or sting MAY prove fatal </s>
<s> So may a pin scratch if the blood of the subject be in bad enough condition </s>
<s> There is a wellsubstantiated case of a trained nurse who died from blood poisoning following a mosquito bite </s>
<s> Ant bite has resulted fatally as has a single sting from the common wasp </s>
<s> No one however considers these everyday insects as deadly </s>
<s> But substitute scorpion for ant and centipede for wasp and shrieks of dismay rise from the general throat </s>
<s> Yet perhaps there is no other variety of harmful creature whose reputation rests upon so meager a foundation as that of these two </s>
<s> True an El Paso report claims that a man stung by a whip scorpion died in twelve hours but the details are so vague as to be in a high degree unconvincing </s>
<s> Dr. Eugene MurrayAaron a witness of unimpeachable scientific competency describes the sting after several personal encounters with the vigorous tropical species as no worse than that of a large hornet </s>
<s> Dr. L </s>
<s> B </s>
<s> Rowland of Florida says My wife has been stung several times [by the common scorpion] </s>
<s> It is like a wasp sting only </s>
<s> THE SCORPION'S STING The Mexican scorpion enjoys an evil repute which from personal observation I consider greatly exaggerated </s>
<s> Stewart Edward White was so obliging as to afford me excellent opportunity of judging in the course of a recent hunting trip which we took together in a hot and remote Mexican desert </s>
<s> Mr. White in the process of disrobing sat down upon a brown scorpion an inch and a half long </s>
<s> The scorpion punctured Mr. White twice </s>
<s> I noted his symptoms </s>
<s> They were chiefly surprise and indignation </s>
<s> Within half an hour he was asleep and on the following day he was riding a mule </s>
<s> The scorpion however died </s>
<s> With respect to the centipede satisfactory data are difficult to obtain </s>
<s> Some scientists whose observations are worthy of note state that the legs of this curious creature secrete a poison and that their trail over human flesh is marked by a sort of rash sometimes followed by fever </s>
<s> As showing that this is not an invariable phenomenon I may set the circumstantial account given me by Captain Robert Kemp Wright who at his place at Pitch Lake Trinidad saw a goodsized centipede crawl across the forehead of his sleeping son </s>
<s> Not daring to make a move as the centipede is supposed to strike very swiftly Captain Wright was compelled to stand still while it slowly made its way to the pillow and thence to the floor where it was killed </s>
<s> The boy who had neither waked nor moved showed absolutely no trace of the reptile's course </s>
<s> THE DEADLY TARANTULAIN PRINT The only direct evidence which has come to me regarding the bite of the hundredlegged crawler was from an English naturalist whom I met in Venezuela </s>
<s> He was bitten on the ankle by a centipede nearly a foot long </s>
<s> So severe was the laceration that his sock was clotted with blood before he could get it off </s>
<s> The two punctures were marked </s>
<s> Almost immediately the ankle began to swell </s>
<s> The pain he describes as being equal to a bad toothache </s>
<s> It kept him awake all that night </s>
<s> He had some fever which however he attributes rather to the loss of sleep than to any specific action of the poison as there were no other general symptoms </s>
<s> In the morning the pain had abated a good deal and he believes that he could have gone about his pursuits had he been able to get his sock and shoe on </s>
<s> He noted some discoloration about the wound </s>
<s> Late in the afternoon he was hobbling about </s>
<s> A week in a carpet slipper was the extent of disability which he suffered </s>
<s> On these evidences it would seem just for the present to set down the scorpion and the centipede as painful rather than dangerous assailants </s>
<s> Diseased imagination could invent no creature more horrific of appearance than the tarantula </s>
<s> Its bristling and hostile aspect the swift ferocity of its rush its great size and its enthusiastic preference for combat as against flight are sufficient to account for the fear and respect in which it is generally held </s>
<s> But though several species of the huge spider are native to the United States and others frequently drop out of banana bunches from South or Central America to the discomfiture of the unsuspecting grocer no authentic instance of death from tarantula poison in this country is obtainable </s>
<s> St. Louis papers please copy particularly that one which several years ago announced in appropriately black headlines IN TWO WEEKS Three Men Have Died From Bites of Tarantulas proceeding to explain that the victims were banana handlers in the wholesale fruit district </s>
<s> No names were supplieda common phenomenon in this class of obituary notice </s>
<s> Search in the coroner's records failed to bring to light any case of the sort and an exhaustive inquiry in the fruit district was equally unproductive </s>
<s> The report was a pure fake </s>
<s> Apparently of the same nature is the news story of a Californian who presumably mistaking a tarantula for a fragrant floweret was bitten on the nose and died in great agony </s>
<s> That of course is the proper way to die under such circumstances </s>
<s> They all do itin print </s>
<s> Now let us see about the agony </s>
<s> Herbert H </s>
<s> Smith the naturalist and collector saw a man bitten on the bare foot by a tarantula Mygale so hard as to draw blood </s>
<s> There was very little swelling and the man paid no heed to the occurrence but went on with his work </s>
<s> I have talked with a Southern Pacific Railroad fireman who was jabbed on the wrist by a large tarantula </s>
<s> Some years before he had been stung on the cheek by a bald hornet </s>
<s> He wasn't inclined to make any choice between the two except that the tarantula not the wound looked a dsight more scary </s>
<s> He didn't let the bite interfere with his job even for the day </s>
<s> On the other hand Dr. MurrayAaron records serious symptoms following two bites upon the hand by a large female trapdoor tarantula pain comparable to that of the worst earache involuntary twitching of arms legs lips and tongue great swelling and discoloration of the hand and forearm and considerable suffering for four days with occasionally recurrent pains for a month </s>
<s> This however was in Haiti </s>
<s> And even there he believes death never follows tarantula bite unless the subject is in a depleted state of resistance from blooddisease or other cause </s>
<s> Under the heading Fatal Spider Bite there is a considerable and interesting newspaper bibliography </s>
<s> The details do not analyze well </s>
<s> Often the name of the supposed victim doesn't appear and where names and specifications are given the evidence is hardly sufficient as a rule to convict the insect of any crime more serious than mayhem </s>
<s> For example a young woman in Brooklyn awoke one morning to find a swollen spot on her body </s>
<s> On the bed was according to allegation a spider </s>
<s> Some ten days later she died </s>
<s> For a long period she had been in ill health </s>
<s> Yet the death was credited to the spider though specific symptoms of venomous poisoning were lacking </s>
<s> The instance of a young woman in an Eastern state is significant </s>
<s> Thrusting her foot into an old slipper she felt a sharp jab upon the point of her index digit </s>
<s> Upon hasty removal of the footgear she saw or supposed she saw a large and ferocious spider dart forth </s>
<s> This to her mind was evidence both conclusive and damning </s>
<s> Seizing upon the carving knife she promptly cut off her perfectly good toe bound up the wound and sent for the doctor thereby blossoming out in next day's print as a Heroine who had Saved her own life by her Marvelous Presence of Mind </s>
<s> The thoughtful will wonder however whether the lady wouldn't have got at the real root of the matter by cutting off her head instead of her toe </s>
<s> SPIDER HYSTERIA Imagination and terror undoubtedly account for certain general symptoms in this class of injury </s>
<s> Colonel Nicholas Pike a competent observer records a case of a man slapping his hand down upon a window sill and feeling a lively stab in the palm </s>
<s> At the same moment a small spider ran across the back of his fingers and was captured </s>
<s> There was a distinct puncture in the hand </s>
<s> Here then was a definite case where the wound and the insect were both in evidence </s>
<s> But examination of the arachnid's fangs satisfied Colonel Pike that they were far too small and weak to penetrate the tough skin where the wound was </s>
<s> Meantime the victim exhibited the classic symptoms of venomous poisoning numbness nausea chills and threatened collapse </s>
<s> A physician being summoned examined both the victim and the accused and took Colonel Pike's view that the spider was innocent </s>
<s> The man was wrathful with the indignation of terror </s>
<s> He said he guessed he knew whether he was bitten or not and that the physician's business was to eschew idle speculations and go ahead and save his life if it wasn't already too late </s>
<s> Thereupon the doctor opened up the wound and extracted a section of a fine needle </s>
<s> The other half was found sticking in the window sill where a careless seamstress had fixed it </s>
<s> The spider had been a fortuitous arrival </s>
<s> The man made one of the quickest recoveries recorded </s>
<s> THE REDSPOTDANGEROUS Strangely enough the one really dangerous spider on the American continent is small obscure and practically unknown to popular or journalistic hysteria </s>
<s> Latrodectus mactans is its scientific name </s>
<s> It is about the size of a large pea black with a red spot on the backa useful danger signaland spins a small web in outhouses or around woodpiles </s>
<s> So far as is known its poison is the most virulent and powerful drop for drop secreted by any living creature </s>
<s> Cobra virus in the minute quantity which the Latrodectus's glands contain would probably have no appreciable effect upon man whereas the tiny spider's venom in the volume injected by the cobra's stroke would slay a herd of elephants </s>
<s> Were this littleknown crawler as large as the common black hunting spider of our gardens and lawns its bite would be almost invariably fatal </s>
<s> Happily the redspot's fangs being small and weak can with difficulty penetrate the skin and are able to inject venom in dangerous quantity only when the bite is inflicted upon some tenderskinned portion of the body </s>
<s> Nevertheless fatalities consequent upon the bite of this insect are sufficiently well attested to take rank as established scientific facts </s>
<s> One of the most detailed comes from an intelligent farmer of Greensboro North Carolina </s>
<s> A workman in his employ while hauling wood brushed at something crawling upon his neck and felt a sharp stinging sensation </s>
<s> He found a small black spider with a red spot </s>
<s> This was at 8.30 A.M. Presently ten small white pimples appeared about the bitten spot though no puncture was visible and there was no swelling </s>
<s> The pain soon passed but returned in three hours and became general finally settling in the abdomen and producing violent cramps </s>
<s> At one o'clock the man had a spasmodic attack </s>
<s> Two hours later he had so far recovered as to be able to go back to work for an hour </s>
<s> Then the spasms took him again he sank into coma and died between ten and eleven o'clock that evening about fourteen hours after the bite </s>
<s> At no time were there local symptoms or swelling other than the slight eruption but the neck left arm and breast are reported as having assumed a stonelike hardness </s>
<s> The same farmer had seen three years previous a negro who had been bitten upon the ankle by a redspot and who suffered from diminishingly severe spasmodic attacks for three weeks </s>
<s> The white pimples appeared in this case also </s>
<s> The negro recovered but the eruption reappeared for years thereafter whenever he was overheated </s>
<s> Recoveries from Latrodectus bite are much more common in the records than deaths </s>
<s> Dr. Corson of Savannah Georgia reports six cases characterized by agonizing pains spasmodic contractions like those of tetanus and grave general symptoms </s>
<s> All recovered </s>
<s> From Anaheim California a fatal case is reported by Dr. Bickford death occurring twenty hours after the bite </s>
<s> William A </s>
<s> Ball of San Bernardino California gives a vivid account of his sensations after being bitten on the groin by a redspotted spider the data being attested by his physician </s>
<s> Shortly after being bitten he began to suffer great agony with convulsive contractions of the muscles </s>
<s> The pains in my hipjoints chest and thighs grew rapidly more violent until it seemed that the bones in these parts of my body were being crushed to fragments </s>
<s> He was seriously ill for ten days </s>
<s> WORSE TEXAN THE DEADLY COPPERHEAD It may be that only under certain uncomprehended conditions is the venom of the Latrodectus effective </s>
<s> Inoculation of guinea pigs with the poison has been without any resultant symptoms </s>
<s> Scientific experimenters have suffered themselves to be bitten and have experienced no ill effects </s>
<s> The foreign cousins of the American species however have as evil a repute as the mactans </s>
<s> The katipo found in sedges on the beach of New Zealand is dreaded by the Maoris who traditionally refuse to sleep nearer than half a stone's throw from the water that being the extent of range of the spider </s>
<s> The Latrodecti of Corsica Algeria and France are infamous in the lore of the country folk which fact must be regarded as strongly evidential when their insignificant appearance is taken into account </s>
<s> Only in America is there no popular fear of this really formidable little creature </s>
<s> Yet it is found in almost every part of the United States though by no means one of the commoner spiders </s>
<s> In the past five years I have seen two specimens at my country place in central New York and have heard of a dozen others </s>
<s> If people understood generally that this rather ornamental insect is both more perilous to life and health and rather more prone to attack human beings than the superstitiously dreaded deadly copperhead there would probably be a heavy mortality in the Latrodectus family at the hands of energetic housecleaners </s>
<s> THE RISE OF THE KISSINGBUG Years ago the United States Bureau of Entomology received from an exasperated clergyman in Georgia a dead insect enclosed in this note Prof </s>
<s> Riley What is this devil </s>
<s> He sailed down on my hedge </s>
<s> I took hold of his lone front leg and as quick as lightning he speared me under my thumb nail and I dropped him </s>
<s> My thumb and whole arm are still paining me . . . The miscreant was a fine specimen of Reduvius personatus the conenosed bloodsucker soon thereafter to achieve heights of newspaper notoriety together with its cousin Melanolestes picipes as the kissingbug </s>
<s> How many persons died in type from kissingbug bites in the year of enlightened civilization 1899 will never be known </s>
<s> But from far and near from California and Connecticut and the Carolinas from Minnesota and Maryland and Maine came startling reports of this hitherto unfamed creature's depredations upon the human countenance </s>
<s> Thereby the spider family was relieved of much unmerited odium for it is more than suspected by entomologists that a large proportion of socalled spider bites are really the work of the more vicious but less formidableappearing kissingbug as is often evidenced by the nature of the puncture </s>
<s> The kissingbug is about half an inch in length flatbacked shaped in geometrically regular angles and armed with a large hard beak </s>
<s> It is this beak which does the damage for the kissingbug is a fighter and will risk a prod at anything that gives it cause of offense </s>
<s> Testimony is not lacking that it sometimes punctures the human epidermis with a view to obtaining blood at first hand instead of from its natural prey </s>
<s> But the curious feature of the kissingbug's bite is its after effect </s>
<s> Neither the southern Reduvius nor the northern Melanolestes possesses any venom apparatus </s>
<s> Now an insect without fangs or sting duct and poison gland can no more envenom the object of its attack than a fish can kick a man to death </s>
<s> Yet we find such authorities as Dr. L </s>
<s> O </s>
<s> Howard the United States Entomologist Professor Le Conte Mr. Charles Drury of Cincinnati and others including a mass of medical witnesses declaring from firsthand observation that the kissingbug bite causes much swelling and severe pain </s>
<s> Le Conte indeed compares the effect to snake bite and states that people are seriously affected for a week </s>
<s> A case is recorded from Holland South Carolina where there were vomiting and marked weakness </s>
<s> Mr. Schwartz an expert of the Bureau of Entomology at Washington was bitten twice upon the hand and testifies to the painful effects </s>
<s> In 1899 when the species was very common in Washington the Emergency Hospital had a long list of patients who appeared on the records under the heading Insect Bite </s>
<s> THE DECLINE OF THE KISSINGBUG Thus was started the general scare a reporter with a keen nose for news having made a legitimate sensation from the repeated entries on the hospital roster </s>
<s> From Washington it spread over the country and became the topic of the day until any insect bite or stingmosquito hornet bedbug or whatnotwas magnified by the hysteria of the patient and the credulousness of the public into a dangerous instance of kissingbug poisoning </s>
<s> Reports of fatal cases however invariably proved to be canards </s>
<s> For explanation of the marked local symptoms resultant upon attack by the insect science has been hard put to it </s>
<s> The general symptoms observed in a few cases where violent may probably be ascribed to shock and nervousness </s>
<s> But the marked swelling and pain cannot be thus dismissed </s>
<s> Medical men believe that the insect in its various prowlings for food thrusts its exploring beak into decaying animal and vegetable matter and thus in a sense so poisons it that when it comes into contact with human blood a rapid local infection is set upnot through any specific poison as in spider bite or bee sting but by the agency of the putrefactive germs collected on the weapon </s>
<s> Not the least interesting phase of the kissingbug scare is the rapidity and completeness of its decadence </s>
<s> It is but ten years ago that the newspapers rang with it that victims of the bite in every city were fleeing whitefaced and racked with forebodings to doctor or hospital </s>
<s> Today both the Melanolestes and the conenose are abroad in the land </s>
<s> Doubtless upon provocation they are spearing others as they speared the outraged clergyman </s>
<s> But that's all </s>
<s> The bepunctured ones do not seek the consolations of medical or journalistic attention </s>
<s> They put a little wet mud or peroxide on the place and let it go at that </s>
<s> Exit another bogy </s>
<s> OUR REAL POISON PERIL One venomous creature there is in this country which may justly be termed a public peril in the widest sense </s>
<s> Proportionately to population more victims fall to it yearly in the United States than to the dreaded cobra in India </s>
<s> Some twelve thousand Americans are killed every year by its bite </s>
<s> Three hundred thousand more are made seriously ill from the after effects </s>
<s> Unfortunately the virus works so slowly that alarm is stilled </s>
<s> The victims do not sicken at once </s>
<s> The bite is forgotten but ten days or two weeks after the subject falls into a fever </s>
<s> His blood is poisoned within him </s>
<s> Eventually in extreme cases he becomes delirious succumbs to a stupor and dies </s>
<s> Yet because there is nothing horrific to the sensationloving imagination in the malariabearing mosquito public inertia or ignorance tolerates it with a grin and permits it to breed in city and country alike throughout the length and breadth of the nation </s>
<s> Compared with it as a real menace all the combined brood of snakes scorpions centipedes tarantulas and other pet bugaboos of our childish romanticism are utterly negligible are as figment to reality as shadow to substance </s>
<s> It is perhaps characteristic of our wryly humorous American temperament that we should have invested the unimportant danger with all the shuddering attributes of horror and have made of the real peril a joke to be perennially hailed with laughter in a thousand thoughtless prints </s>

<s> SCULL Field Manager of the Buffalo Jones African Expedition II SOMEHOW everything seemed to happen on moving day with the Buffalo Jones Expedition in East Africa </s>
<s> Exactly why this should have been it is impossible to tell </s>
<s> Perhaps the reason may be found in the fact that a considerable part of our time was occupied in moving </s>
<s> No doubt the circumstance could be traced to some such perfectly reasonable cause </s>
<s> But we chose to look upon it otherwise </s>
<s> When an outfit like ours has been working for a while in the open countryespecially when the undertaking has no precedent and the outcome is decidedly uncertainthe little happenings of each day gradually grow to have a peculiar significance of their own and finally a brandnew set of superstitions is formed and half jokingly believed in by every one concerned </s>
<s> In this way an expedition comes to be regarded as lucky or unlucky or lucky on certain days or at certain hours of the day or at certain periods of the moon </s>
<s> The wide reaches of the African veldt have something to do with it perhaps </s>
<s> These superstitions are temporary local and often purely personal affairs </s>
<s> Means being a cowboy believed that when he rode his bigboned bay the drive would be successful </s>
<s> The native dogboy insisted that when the longeared bloodhound and the little white terrier were coupled together on the march the rest of the pack would come through without mishap </s>
<s> Loveless swore by a particular piece of rope and Macwhich is short for Mohammeddiscovered propitious omens on every conceivable occasion </s>
<s> It was on the first day's march into the Kedong Valley that we had roped the warthog </s>
<s> On the journey from Sewell's Farm to Rugged Rocks we had rounded up and photographed the eland </s>
<s> Again it was on the trek of March 8 to the Wangai River that we had caught our only glimpses of rhinoceros and lionfaint chances of making a capture but still chances and better than no signs at all </s>
<s> And thus merely because it had turned out so in the past every member of the expedition had come to entertain a semiserious belief that something momentous was bound to happen on moving day </s>
<s> A general feeling of expectancy pervaded the entire safari when we broke camp at the Wangai River at dawn of a hazy morning </s>
<s> The sky was clear of clouds but behind the hills of the Mau escarpment a veldt fire had been burning for several days so that a veil of smoke was seen hanging in the air as the dawn broadened into day </s>
<s> The smell of the burning veldt and the nearness of the fire lent an oppressive warmth to the still morning </s>
<s> You two boys had better carry your heavy ropes the Colonel said at starting </s>
<s> We might meet something </s>
<s> We had finished with the Kedong and Rift valleys </s>
<s> We had hunted every corner of the district within striking distance of the water </s>
<s> And we had had success of a kind </s>
<s> Cheetah eland hartebeest and servalcat we had roped and tied and photographed </s>
<s> But the really big game had so far escaped us </s>
<s> For this reason we had decided to take the road over the Mau where the smoke haze hung heavy and so on into the Sotik country where both lion and rhino were said to abound </s>
<s> For the first ten miles of the march our way led across untraveled country toward the two deep ruts in the veldt that were known as the wagon road </s>
<s> We had an extra oxwagon with us now in charge of Mr. Curry an Africander who lived with his partner on a farm on the border of the Sotik and who on his return journey home with his wagon had agreed to help us carry supplies </s>
<s> Curry was slight and roundshouldered with light yellow hair </s>
<s> His face was burned a bright red excepting his nose which was white where the skin was peeling </s>
<s> He had a peculiar slow drawling way of talkingwhen he talked at all which was seldom </s>
<s> Being an inhabitant of the district into which we were going he was naturally subjected at first to a number of questions in regard to the big game there </s>
<s> Plenty of rhino in your part of the world I suppose </s>
<s> Yas drawled Curry </s>
<s> And lion too I imagine </s>
<s> Yas </s>
<s> Ought to get some giraffe on the way hadn't we </s>
<s> Yas </s>
<s> Rhino pretty scarce just now though aren't they </s>
<s> Yas Curry answered placidly </s>
<s> Thus it soon became apparent that Curry's chief ambition was to agree pleasantly with whatever anybody said which tended to discredit any information he had to impart </s>
<s> So as a matter of course the questions ceased and when no more were asked him Curry's conversation ceased also </s>
<s> It was rough going for the oxwagons those first ten miles and they made slow time of it along the base of the hills </s>
<s> According to our custom on the march the Colonel and the two cowboys the picture department composed of Kearton and Gobbet and Ulyate the white hunter and myself rode in a widely extended line in front of the safari sweeping the country for game </s>
<s> It was hot at the base of the hillsso hot that when your bridle hand dropped inadvertently to the pommel of the saddle the brass mounting there seemed to burn you </s>
<s> Not a breath of air was stirring and the sun shone down blazing through the wisps of smoke haze and the heat waves rose from the dead parched veldt so that the distant southern volcano looked all quivering </s>
<s> Then from out the blurred vista in front little by little a clump of comparatively large trees began to take definite shape </s>
<s> Another half mile farther and we saw that something was moving among the trees as high up as the topmost branches </s>
<s> Giraffe said Ulyate and no sooner had he spoken the word than the great towering animals wheeled and fled from their shelter with that longlegged gallop of theirs which looks so easy and slow but which carries them over the ground as fast as a speedy horse can run </s>
<s> The Colonel and the two cowboys set off at a hand gallop in a vain attempt to round them up and drive them back to the cameras </s>
<s> The race was a hopeless one for the horsemen from the start </s>
<s> But according to the general method of operations adopted by the Colonel from the very beginning no chance of a capture however slim it might appear was to remain untried so long as men and horses could endure </s>
<s> The two ruts of the wagon road led close by the grove of trees and when the rest of us reached this spot and dismounted to await results the three leading horsemen had disappeared long ago into the scrubgrown country to the south </s>
<s> As noon approached the heat became more and more oppressive </s>
<s> The cameras had been screwed to the tripods and covered with our coats to protect them from the sun </s>
<s> The horses grazed near by </s>
<s> Mac was sent up one of the trees to warn us of the approach of anything like a giraffe and the rest of us sat on the ground round the bole in the small circle of thin shade and lazily watched the black ants always crawling and climbing and zigzagging back and forth over the network of fallen twigs and leaves </s>
<s> It was too hot to talkit was too hot to sleep or think </s>
<s> And by and by the oxwagons came up and the oxen brought the flies </s>
<s> For a time then the only sounds were the slow crunching of the feeding horses and an occasional inarticulate snarl from some one or other who foolishly tried to brush the flies away from his face </s>
<s> Eventually after a long time had passed Means rode into the grove of trees unheralded by Mac and alone </s>
<s> The bay horse had fallen badly wrenching his rider's back where once he had been hurt before </s>
<s> Means took his saddle off threw it on the ground and sat on it </s>
<s> He dropped into a pig hole he explained an' hopped out again as neat as could be </s>
<s> But in hoppin' out he hopped into another an' that just naturally discouraged him an' he come down with me </s>
<s> No comments were made nor did Means expect any </s>
<s> But evidently he had considered it only justice to the bay that the mishap should receive from him the proper explanation </s>
<s> Then Loveless returned also alone </s>
<s> He made a few grumbling remarks about its being all nonsense to run the horses to death when there was no chance at all </s>
<s> But as his listeners showed not the slightest interest in the matter he too relapsed into silence </s>
<s> The Colonel was the last to come in </s>
<s> He rode straight to the tree where the company were gathered dismounted and sat down </s>
<s> Then he spoke to the world at large </s>
<s> They must be about here somewhere he said </s>
<s> And being about here somewhere we'll get 'em yet </s>
<s> When the shadow beneath the tree began to lengthen toward the east the safari shook itself together and prepared to move on once more </s>
<s> But this time instead of occupying his customary position at the head of the column the Colonel lagged behind </s>
<s> Immediately after leaving the grove of trees the road commenced to climb the first rises of the Mau escarpment </s>
<s> As we mounted higher up the hillside the view behind us opened out into a grand panorama of the two valleys and their sentinel volcanoes with the smoke haze hanging over all </s>
<s> For a time those of us who were in front rode half sideways in the saddle looking back over the way we had come and over the district we had grown to know so well </s>
<s> Then we crossed a small level park that formed the crest of the first hill and as we moved down the western slope the view behind us disappeared and the new country spread before us </s>
<s> Kearton was riding with his head sunk on his chest like a sick man </s>
<s> Gobbet asked if anything was wrong with him </s>
<s> Nothing bad too much heat this morning likely </s>
<s> Want to hunt a bit of shade and lie up awhile </s>
<s> No I'll go on </s>
<s> Gobbet shrugged his shoulders </s>
<s> You're the judge he said </s>
<s> Hill after hill stretched away in front to the one upstanding kopje that marked the top of the Mau </s>
<s> The district was wooded with small twisted trees and the fire had crossed here so that the ground was black and the air smelled stronger of burning </s>
<s> Presently Means stopped </s>
<s> I'd better wait till the Colonel comes along he explained </s>
<s> The Colonel don't carry any weapons </s>
<s> Loveless stopped with him and as Ulyate was somewhere behind with the oxwagons and porters this left Kearton Gobbet and myself to ride on by ourselves </s>
<s> For a mile or more the road lifted and dipped with monotonous regularity and the burnt land was still on either hand without a sign of life anywhere to be seen </s>
<s> So when the sun really began to decline toward the west Gobbet who had once been assistant manager of the Alhambra Music Hall in Brighton told the story of Harry Lauder and the liquid air biscuits and it seemed to do Kearton good </s>
<s> Kearton had just told Gobbet to quit his lying when all three of us realized that for the last half minute we had been unconsciously listening to the beat of a galloping horse on the road behind </s>
<s> The next instant Ulyate pulled up in a cloud of dust </s>
<s> Colonel wants you he said </s>
<s> They've rounded up a giraffe </s>
<s> We wheeled the horses and started back on the run </s>
<s> Aboutthreemiles </s>
<s> Leftof theroad </s>
<s> Ulyate shouted after us </s>
<s> There were various reasons that called for haste </s>
<s> How long the ropers could keep the giraffe rounded up was especially uncertain and then besides it was near the end of the day and soon the light would be too far gone for a picture </s>
<s> We met the line of porters and they scattered right and left </s>
<s> Farther on the oxteams crowded one side to give us room </s>
<s> Then we came upon the four special porters with the cameras </s>
<s> Kearton took his machine on the saddle with him and Gobbet caught up the tripod from another pair of outstretched arms </s>
<s> When we reached the bit of clearing and looked to the left of the road we saw the long neck and head of a giraffe sharply outlined against the sky </s>
<s> The giraffe stood motionless </s>
<s> His feet were spread a little apart as though he was prepared to dash away again at the first opportunity and he gazed in a curious way first at one then at another of the three ropers that surrounded him and now sat their horses waiting </s>
<s> There was still enough light left for a picture but Kearton was nearly done </s>
<s> Give him a minute's breather said the Colonel </s>
<s> We'll hold the critter till he's ready </s>
<s> We took Kearton off his horse and stretched him on the ground and poured the lukewarm water from a canteen on his head </s>
<s> Meanwhile Cobbet screwed the camera to the tripod and set it up </s>
<s> By the time Gobbet had finished Kearton was on his feet again </s>
<s> From his position near by Means ventured the opinion that it was too much excitement that had knocked him over and Kearton swore back at him pleasantly and went to work </s>
<s> A highpitched yell from the Colonel sent the giraffe away across the open with that clumsylooking powerful gallop that is all his own and with his long neck plunging slowly back and forth </s>
<s> Loveless's black one of the fastest horses in the string had hard work to gain on the giraffe expecially as the animal swerved quickly at the last moment and fled down the eastern slope of the hill through the scrub where the going was none too good </s>
<s> It was a difficult throwand a new one for a Western cowboyto send the noose so far up into the air over the head perched high on the long swaying neck </s>
<s> But at the first attempt Loveless succeeded and then reined in gently so as not to throw the beast because a giraffe would fall heavily and would very likely break his neck or a leg if tumbled over </s>
<s> Finally he was brought to a standstill his feet spread apart as before and for a while the two stood facing each otherthe cowboy and the towering giraffe with the rope from the saddle horn leading up at a considerable angle to the shoulders of the prize </s>
<s> The rest of the hunt soon gathered about them </s>
<s> Although the light was rapidly failing Kearton finished what was left of his roll of film </s>
<s> The whir of the camera ended with a peculiar flapping sound </s>
<s> That's all said Kearton and sank down on a nearby stone </s>
<s> But Loveless and the giraffe continued to face each other undisturbed </s>
<s> Well </s>
<s> said Loveless presently </s>
<s> Well </s>
<s> echoed the Colonel </s>
<s> Well how are we going to take this rope off him </s>
<s> We've got none to spare you know </s>
<s> Get a ladder suggested Means </s>
<s> No we won't need a ladder said the Colonel seriously but we'll have to throw him after all </s>
<s> We can do it gently I guess without hurting him </s>
<s> Accordingly Means roped the giraffe by one hind leg and pulled it out from under him so that he sank easily to the ground and both the ropes were loosened and freed </s>
<s> The sun had set and the short twilight was rapidly deepening </s>
<s> The oxwagons and porters were several miles ahead </s>
<s> So we packed up the camera coiled up the ropes mounted and rode away and the giraffe raised himself on his haunches among the bushes and watched us go </s>
<s> We camped at a water hole that night and started on again the next morning in the darkness before the dawn with a porter ahead carrying a lantern to show the way </s>
<s> With oxwagons it is a three days' journey from that water hole to the Guas Nyiro River at the border of the Sotik </s>
<s> The country through which we passed continued to be the same as that of the Mau escarpmenta succession of low hills and shallow valleys covered with the small twisted trees </s>
<s> And there was plenty of water on the way </s>
<s> But there was no game in the district </s>
<s> We had been told before starting that we need not expect to see anything on the way because antelope zebra and such like animals avoid the wooded section so as not to be caught unaware by lions and since the prey seek the safety of the open plains the lions are compelled to follow </s>
<s> In spite of this fact and although the dense woods and broken ground generally forced the safari to keep to the road the cowboys were always ready and the cameras always loaded with film </s>
<s> But the land on either side remained silent and deserted </s>
<s> And each day's journey was the same as the one before the start in the gray of the morning the long hot ride with the road gently rising and falling over the hills and the sudden cool of the evening when the sun went down </s>
<s> At times the camera department would take moving pictures of the wagons and porters crossing a river where an especially picturesque bit of scenery offered an attractive setting </s>
<s> Occasionally Means as he rode along would commence singing one of the songs of our Western plains verse after verse seemingly without end recounting in detail some local historical event such as an Indian attack on an army post a shooting affair at a dance or a trainrobber's hanging </s>
<s> He would sing more to himself than to anybody else and if this began to bore him at all he would stop in the middle and leave the story untold </s>
<s> Then sometimes when we outspanned for an hour at noon the four special camera porters would give imitations of Kearton and Gobbet taking pictures of Loveless shoeing horses or of Means in the act of roping </s>
<s> And in the evenings when the day's march was done and the outpost fires had been lighted the talk of the company would turn to our chances of finding luck in the Sotik country that lay ahead </s>
<s> In the afternoon of March 16 we reached Webb's Farm in the Guas Nyiro valley which lies at the edge of the big plains </s>
<s> In this neighborhood there were three farmsWebb's Curry's and Agate'sand on the evening of our arrival some of their men paid a visit to the camp </s>
<s> They had heard of the expedition and each in turn examined the horses the dogs the ropes and the saddles and then like the hunters at Nairobi asked the inevitable question But how are you going to do it </s>
<s> Oh we'll do it somehow the Colonel replied goodnaturedly </s>
<s> And the visitors shook their heads a little and smiled and changed the subject </s>
<s> But to attempt to rope a rhinoceros or a lion required fresh horses and ever since we had left Nairobi nearly a fortnight ago we had worked our horses hard every day </s>
<s> Now that we had reached the land of the big game the Colonel for the first time called a day of rest </s>
<s> So we loafed about camp from sunrise to sunset and by evening were heartily sick of it all </s>
<s> Perhaps we had expected too much of this Sotik country perhaps the expedition was running temporarily in a streak of bad luck but the fact remains that when we resumed hunting on March 18 disappointment only followed disappointment </s>
<s> As we had done in the Rift Valley so here we adopted the method of sweeping the country with a widely extended line </s>
<s> The first day we rode far to the southward to the Hot Springs and back and found nothing and an unreasoning depression settled upon the expedition </s>
<s> The next day we rode still farther to the westward this time and again found nothing and so the depression deepened </s>
<s> Also on the afternoon of this day it rained heavily and Curry agreed with Ulyate that this probably meant the beginning of the rainy season which was already overdue </s>
<s> That night at the supper table the Colonel spoke his mind </s>
<s> The rain was dripping through the canvas fly overhead and the Colonel wore his broadbrimmed hat to help keep the water off his plate </s>
<s> There's no use hanging round here any longer he said not a bit of use </s>
<s> We haven't seen anything nor a sign of anything </s>
<s> When the rains begin in earnest this ground will soften fast an' the horses will get bogged an' we'll have to quit </s>
<s> So from now on we've got to work fast </s>
<s> Now Ulyate says there's water about twelve miles from here to the northcalled the Soda Swamp </s>
<s> We'll start for the Soda Swamp in the morning </s>
<s> Again it was moving day </s>
<s> The morning dawned fine after the rain and the air was clear and the country looked greener and fresher than it had ever looked before </s>
<s> By the time the sun rose the first wagon was packed so the safari set out on the journey leaving the second wagon to load and follow our tracks for there was no road to the Soda Swamp </s>
<s> At the last moment the Colonel decided that he and the cowboys might just as well make a circuit to the westward of the line of march on the off chance of finding game </s>
<s> We covered that district pretty thoroughly yesterday he said </s>
<s> But still you never can tell </s>
<s> Yet nobody thought it worth while for the camera department to go with them and so Kearton and Gobbet and the four special porters trailed along with the slow plodding wagon </s>
<s> In the first place the wagons would follow the shortest route and the horses would be none the worse for an easy day in the second if by the remotest chance the Colonel flushed anything worth while he could more easily find the cameras </s>
<s> Curry had remained behind to bring on the second load and soon Ulyate left us to make a detour past Agate's farm to procure another sack of rice that was badly needed </s>
<s> Ours was a large safari and the details of transportation required close attention </s>
<s> The morning wore on </s>
<s> The sky remained clear and the heat became intense </s>
<s> The direction in which we were traveling led us along the border of the plains through small green parks scattered groves of trees and scrub </s>
<s> So far as the mounted men were concerned the march was a succession of rides and halts </s>
<s> The heavily laden oxwagon traveled slowly and it soon became our custom to dismount in a bit of shade and let the wagon pass ahead about a mile when we would mount again and catch up with it and then repeat the process </s>
<s> At one of these places there was a grassgrown mound against which we sat leaning comfortably and speculated on the distance we had come and the distance we had to go </s>
<s> When after a while it became evident that we should never agree in the matter the conversation altered to a sort of spasmodic affair </s>
<s> I thought this district was so full of big game that you couldn't sleep at night for the lions roaring around you Gobbet remarked lazily </s>
<s> Wait till you get among them said Kearton </s>
<s> Sais keep that horse farther away he'll be walking on us next </s>
<s> Well I haven't been kept awake any yet Gobbet replied </s>
<s> I wonder where that wagon's got to and Kearton raised himself on one elbow and peered ahead from beneath the downtilted brim of his helmet </s>
<s> Then he lay back again and shut his eyes </s>
<s> Means is coming he said </s>
<s> The announcement occasioned no surprise </s>
<s> Undoubtedly Means had some reason for returning over the trail and when he reached the mound we should probably learn what he wanted </s>
<s> Means dismounted and sat down beside us </s>
<s> We've found a rhino over in the next valley yonder he remarked and nodded his head toward the west </s>
<s> A rhino is no matter to joke about said Gobbet </s>
<s> Please remember that in future </s>
<s> I'm not jokin' said Means </s>
<s> Colonel's watchin' him </s>
<s> Loveless stopped halfway here about three miles off </s>
<s> Colonel sent me to bring the rest of you and get the heavy rope </s>
<s> Is that right Means </s>
<s> Kearton asked sharply </s>
<s> Sure </s>
<s> Come on then </s>
<s> In five minutes we had overtaken the wagon and stopped it and while Means clambered up on to the load to hunt for the heavy rope Kearton collected the camera porters and started ahead with them in the direction Means pointed out </s>
<s> But Means could not find the rope he wanted </s>
<s> He threw off half the load without success </s>
<s> It's on the other wagon </s>
<s> There's where it is he finally concluded </s>
<s> No time to wait now </s>
<s> Other wagon likely hasn't started yet </s>
<s> We'll have to do with what we've got </s>
<s> We rode on at an easy jog to keep the horses fresh and at the end of half an hour we came upon Loveless waiting for us just beneath the crest of a rise </s>
<s> He had offsaddled his horse and had turned him loose to graze a bit before the coming work and a few minutes were occupied while Loveless saddled up again and Kearton and Gobbet adjusted their cameras and took them on their horses </s>
<s> Finally every one was ready and we set forth once more on a wide detour to the north to approach the beast from down the wind </s>
<s> Loveless gave us the latest news The Colonel came over the rise a half hour ago and said the rhino was laying down resting quiet </s>
<s> The Colonel went back again at once to keep watch </s>
<s> As we proceeded farther on the circuit and began to ride down the gentle slope into the adjacent valley we slowed down the pace to a cautious walk </s>
<s> No one spoke and on the grass of the veldt the tread of the horses made scarcely any sound </s>
<s> Suddenly the Colonel appeared walking toward us bent low </s>
<s> He had backed out o' his hidingplace behind a clump of scrub </s>
<s> He's laying down over there about a hundred yards away he whispered </s>
<s> Now we want to catch the start of the show </s>
<s> You boys ready </s>
<s> Means tightened his cinch and shook his rope loose and coiled it up again </s>
<s> Loveless said he was ready </s>
<s> One of the saises produced the Colonel's horse from behind another clump of scrub and Kearton dismounted and began creeping forward with his camera </s>
<s> Don't start him up till I get my position he cautioned </s>
<s> I'll wave my hand </s>
<s> On account of the growth of low bushes we could not see the rhino but in silence we watched Kearton tiptoeing farther and farther ahead toward the spot where the Colonel had said the beast was lying down </s>
<s> The time was approximately a little after noon </s>
<s> The wind that was blowing was light and same to us hot over the sunny reaches of veldt </s>
<s> The sky was cloudless </s>
<s> Then the three ropers commenced maneuvering forward swinging out a little to the right </s>
<s> Kearton stopped </s>
<s> He set up his camera and sighted it and took out his handkerchief and carefully wiped the lens </s>
<s> When Kearton waved his hand the Colonel's yell shattered the stillness and the great beast heaved up out of the grass and tossed his head and sniffed the air and snorted </s>
<s> The horsemen rode full tilt at him and with surprising quickness the rhino wheeled and broke away south down the valley </s>
<s> For a good three miles the rhino ran straight and fast </s>
<s> Finally he came into more open country which was dotted here and therewith small thorn trees </s>
<s> Here also in one place there was a fairsized pool of water left over from the rains of the night before </s>
<s> The rhino selected this pool as a good position from which to act on the defensive </s>
<s> He splashed into the water stopped and faced the horsemen </s>
<s> Then followed a few minutes' respite for all concerned </s>
<s> The horses were panting heavily after the sharp run and the rhino's position in the pool rendered it difficult to approach him for a chance to throw a rope </s>
<s> Evidently considering himself safe for the moment the beast rolled once or twice in the water and then stood on guard as before but with his black sides dripping </s>
<s> We've got to get him out of that said the Colonel </s>
<s> A horse wouldn't stand a show there </s>
<s> Now when I get him to charge me you boys stand by </s>
<s> Before the Colonel finished speaking he was already edging toward the pool </s>
<s> For fifteen yards the rhino watched him coming </s>
<s> Then with a great snort he charged out of the water sending the white spray flying in every direction and the Colonel had to ride hard to keep ahead of the tossing horn </s>
<s> But Means was after the rhino like a flash and with a quick throw caught him round the neck </s>
<s> The big bay fell back on his haunches and the rope snapped like twine </s>
<s> We'll miss that heavy rope today Means said </s>
<s> We'll tie him up with what we've got the Colonel replied </s>
<s> Only we've got to tire him out some first </s>
<s> What we'll do is to make him charge us one after the other so he'll run three times to the horses' running once </s>
<s> It was a full half hour before the next attempt was made to throw a rope </s>
<s> Time after time the rhino came plunging out of the water to charge the nearest horseman </s>
<s> Our Western horses proved to be only just a trifle faster than the rhino so that each time the beast nearly caught them </s>
<s> Besides here and there the ground was bad with antbear holes which had to be avoided for a fall would mean disaster </s>
<s> But little by little it became apparent that the rhino's continual charging was beginning to produce an effect </s>
<s> In the meanwhile the rest of the chase was coming up </s>
<s> In the distance we could see them hurrying down the valleyhorsemen and porters considerably scattered as if each one followed a route of his own choosing Kearton led on his big chestnut </s>
<s> He was carrying the heavy camera under his arm the tripod over his shoulder </s>
<s> The reins were hanging loose over his saddle horn his heels were thumping the horse's sides and the perspiration was streaming down his face </s>
<s> We lost you he panted </s>
<s> How's it going </s>
<s> What a picture </s>
<s> Mac the Mohammedan and Aro the Masai warrior took the apparatus from him and he dismounted and went to work </s>
<s> At the second attempt to rope the beast Loveless caught him by one hind leg and the rhino decided to shift his base of operations to an anthill in the neighboring clearing </s>
<s> His mode of progression was to walk on three legs and to drag the black horse after him with the other </s>
<s> He reached the anthill and demolished it and paused for a breathing spell </s>
<s> The chase followed after and Kearton went into action on the north and Gobbet on the south near a small thorn tree with a negro porter beside him </s>
<s> The rhino caught sight of Gobbet's camera and charged </s>
<s> The porter went up the tree like a flash </s>
<s> Gobbet was bent over looking through his viewfinder which of course gave him no idea of how fast the beast was bearing down on him nor how close he had already come </s>
<s> Look out </s>
<s> yelled the Colonel </s>
<s> Gobbet glanced up over the top of the camera and made a jump for the tree </s>
<s> But the porter was already in the branches and the tree was so small there was not room for two and Gobbet had to run for it </s>
<s> The next second with a powerful upward stroke of his horn the rhino sent the apparatus flying </s>
<s> Then Means succeeded in attracting his attention and he charged the horseman instead </s>
<s> Gobbet picked up the debris found that the tripodhead was split clean in two as with an axe found the camera itself undamaged found there was enough head left to support the camera quickly mounted his machine again and was just in time to catch the end of the rhino's chase after Means </s>
<s> And all the while Kearton had his camera trained upon the scene in which his assistant was playing the conspicuous part </s>
<s> I hope I got that good he said it'll make fine actionfine </s>
<s> From one position to another from anthill to thorn tree and back to anthill once more the fight went on through the long hot afternoon </s>
<s> Ropes were thrown and caught and broken mended and thrown again </s>
<s> The horses were pulled all standing one way and another </s>
<s> Rolls of film were exposed and replaced by fresh ones </s>
<s> The rhino sulked and stormed and charged in turn </s>
<s> At the end of the fourth hour Loveless had one short length of light line left </s>
<s> The rest of the ropes were dangling broken from the rhino's legs and neck as he stood at bay over the ruins of the anthill </s>
<s> The sun was rapidly canting toward the west </s>
<s> The continual work in the intense heat without food or water was beginning to tell on both horses and men </s>
<s> The rhino was weakening faster </s>
<s> But only one hour of daylight remained and if the beast could hold out till dark we should lose him </s>
<s> There was the dead stump of a tree with the roots protruding lying in the grass near by </s>
<s> The Colonel told Means to fasten the stump to the last piece of line and Loveless rode toward Kearton's machine past the rhino dragging the stump behind him </s>
<s> As the Colonel had foreseen the beast charged at the stump and the loose ropes hanging from him became entangled in the roots </s>
<s> So on they went at a run first Loveless then the stump bounding over the ground then the charging rhino headed straight for Kearton's camera </s>
<s> The Masai warrior stood by the tripod with his long spear poised high and Kearton turned the handle and shouted at Loveless How many times have I got to tell you not to come straight into the lens </s>
<s> Bring him on at an angle </s>
<s> . . . I don't want to be unreasonable he added when the rhino stopped but you ought to have learned better by this time </s>
<s> Then by hauling in gently Loveless succeeded in recovering two of the ropes and they were pieced together and thrown again catching the rhino by one hind leg </s>
<s> Both the cowboys put their horses to work pulling forward on the rope and they lifted that one hind leg ahead </s>
<s> The tired beast shifted his great body after it and thus step by step the horses dragged him up to a tree where Loveless passed the end of the rope two turns around the bole and made it fast </s>
<s> The rhino charged once just before the knot was tied and Loveless had to jump into the branches through the thorns to escape </s>
<s> He charged again rather feebly this time trying to get free but the rope held well and tripped him up </s>
<s> After that he stood quietly at the end of his tether watching the camera in a sullen way while Kearton took his picture with the last few feet of film </s>
<s> By this time the light was almost gone the films were finished horses and men were nearly done and besides it was moving day and high time we resumed the march </s>

<s> 5 NOVEMBER 1910 The Homely Heroine pages 602608 By EDNA FERBER MILLIE WHITCOMB of the fancy goods and notions beckoned me with her finger </s>
<s> I had been standing at Kate O'Malley's counter pretending to admire her new basketweave suitings but in reality reveling in her droll account of how in the train coming up from Chicago Mrs. Judge Porterfield had worn the negro porter's coat over her chilly shoulders in mistake for her husband's </s>
<s> Kate O'Malley can tell a funny story in a way to make the afterdinner pleasantries of a Washington diplomat sound like the clumsy jests told around the village grocery stove </s>
<s> I wanted to tell you that I read that last story of yours said Millie sociably when I had strolled over to her counter and I liked it all but the heroine </s>
<s> She had an `adorable throat' and hair that `waved away from her white brow' and eyes that `now were blue and now gray.' Say why don't you write a story about an ugly girl </s>
<s> My land </s>
<s> protested I </s>
<s> It's bad enough trying to make them accept my stories as it is </s>
<s> That last heroine was a raving beauty but she came back eleven times before the editor of Blakely's succumbed to her charms </s>
<s> Millie's fingers were busy straightening the contents of a tray of combs and imitation jet barrettes </s>
<s> Millie's fingers were not intended for that task </s>
<s> They are slender tapering fingers pinktipped and sensitive </s>
<s> I should think mused she rubbing a cloudy piece of jet with a bit of soft cloth that they'd welcome a homely one with relief </s>
<s> These goddesses are so cloying </s>
<s> Millie Whitcomb's black hair is touched with soft mists of gray and she wears lavender shirtwaists and white stocks edged with lavender </s>
<s> There is a Colonial air about her that has nothing to do with celluloid combs and imitation jet barrettes </s>
<s> It breathes of dim old rooms rich with the tones of mahogany and old brass and Millie in the midst of it graygowned a soft white fichu crossed upon her breast </s>
<s> In our town the clerks are not the pert and gumchewing young persons that storywriters are wont to describe </s>
<s> The girls at Bascom's are institutions </s>
<s> They know us all by our first names and our lives are as an open book to them </s>
<s> Kate O'Malley who has been at Bascom's for so many years that she is rumored to have stock in the company may be said to govern the fashions of our town </s>
<s> She is wont to say when we express a fancy for gray as the color of our new spring suit Oh now Nellie don't get gray again </s>
<s> You had it year before last and don't you think it was just the least leetle bit trying </s>
<s> Let me show you that green that came in yesterday </s>
<s> I said the minute I clapped my eyes on it that it was just the color for you with your brown hair and all </s>
<s> And we end by deciding on the green </s>
<s> The girls at Bascom's are not gossipsthey are too busy for thatbut they may be said to be delightfully well informed </s>
<s> How could they be otherwise when we go to Bascom's for our wedding dresses and party favors and baby flannels </s>
<s> There is news at Bascom's that out daily paper never hears of and wouldn't dare to print if it did </s>
<s> So when Millie Whitcomb of the fancy goods and notions expressed her hunger for a homely heroine I did not resent the suggestion </s>
<s> On the contrary it sent me home in thoughtful mood for Millie Whitcomb has acquired a knowledge of human nature in the dispensing of her fancy goods and notions </s>
<s> It set me casting about for a really homely heroine </s>
<s> There never has been a really ugly heroine in fiction </s>
<s> Authors have started bravely out to write of an unlovely woman but they never have had the courage to allow her to remain plain </s>
<s> On Page 237 she puts on a black lace dress and red roses and the combination brings out unexpected tawny lights in her hair and olive tints in her cheeks and there she is the same old beautiful heroine </s>
<s> Even in the Duchess books one finds the simple Irish girl on donning a green corduroy gown cut square at the neck transformed into a wildrose beauty at sight of whom a ballroom is hushed into admiring awe </s>
<s> There's the case of Jane Eyre too </s>
<s> She is constantly described as plain and mouselike but there are covert hints as to her gray eyes and slender figure and clear skin and we have a sneaking notion that she wasn't such a fright after all </s>
<s> Therefore when I tell you that I am choosing Pearlie Schultz as my leading lady you are to understand that she is ugly not only when the story opens but to the bitter end </s>
<s> In the first place Pearlie is fat </s>
<s> Not plump or rounded or dimpled or deliciously curved but FAT </s>
<s> She bulges in all the wrong places including her chin </s>
<s> Sister who has a way of snooping over my desk in my absence says that I may as well drop this now because nobody would ever read it anyway least of all any sane editor </s>
<s> I protest when I discover that Sis has been over my papers </s>
<s> It bothers me </s>
<s> But she says you have to do these things when you have a genius in the house and cites the case of Kipling's Recessional which was rescued from the depths of his wastebasket by his wife </s>
<s> Pearlie Schultz used to sit on the front porch summer evenings and watch the couples stroll by and weep in her heart </s>
<s> A fat girl with a fat girl's soul is a comedy </s>
<s> But a fat girl with a thin girl's soul is a tragedy </s>
<s> Pearlie in spite of her two hundred pounds had the soul of a willow wand </s>
<s> The walk in front of Pearlie's house was guarded by a row of big trees that cast kindly shadows </s>
<s> The strolling couples used to step gratefully into the embrace of these shadows and from them into other embraces </s>
<s> Pearlie sitting on the porch could see them dimly although they could not see her </s>
<s> She could not help remarking that these strolling couples were strangely lacking in sprightly conversation </s>
<s> Their remarks were but fragmentary disjointed affairs spoken in low tones with a queer tremulous note in them </s>
<s> When they reached the deepest blackest kindliest shadow which fell just before the end of the row of trees the strolling couples almost always stopped and then there came a quick movement and a little smothered cry from the girl and then a sound and then a silence </s>
<s> Pearlie sitting alone on the porch in the dark listened to these things and blushed furiously </s>
<s> Pearlie had never strolled into the kindly shadows with a little beating of the heart and she had never been surprised with a quick arm about her and eager lips pressed warmly against her own </s>
<s> In the daytime Pearlie worked as public stenographer at the Burke Hotel </s>
<s> She rose at seven in the morning and rolled for fifteen minutes and lay on her back and elevated her heels in the air and stood stiff kneed while she touched the floor with her finger tips one hundred times and went without her breakfast </s>
<s> At the end of each month she usually found that she weighed three pounds more than she had the month before </s>
<s> The folks at home never joked with Pearlie about her weight </s>
<s> Even one's family has some respect for a life sorrow </s>
<s> Whenever Pearlie asked that inevitable question of the fat woman Am I as fat as she is </s>
<s> her mother always answered You </s>
<s> Well I should hope not </s>
<s> You're looking real peaked lately Pearlie </s>
<s> And your blue skirt just ripples in the back it's getting so big for you </s>
<s> Of such blessed stuff are mothers made </s>
<s> But if the gods had denied Pearlie all charms of face or form they had been decent enough to bestow on her one gift </s>
<s> Pearlie could cook like an angel no better than an angel for no angel could be a really clever cook and wear those flowing kimonolike sleeves </s>
<s> They'd get into the soup </s>
<s> Pearlie could take a piece of rump and some suet and an onion and a cup or so of water and evolve a pot roast that you could cut with a fork </s>
<s> She could turn out a surprisingly good cake with surprisingly few eggs all covered with white icing and bearing cunning little jelly figures on its snowy bosom </s>
<s> She could beat up biscuits that fell apart at the lightest pressure revealing little pools of golden butter within </s>
<s> Oh Pearlie could cook </s>
<s> On week days Pearlie rattled the typewriter keys but on Sundays she shooed her mother out of the kitchen </s>
<s> Her mother went protesting faintly Now Pearlie don't fuss so for dinner </s>
<s> You ought to get your rest on Sunday instead of stewing over a hot stove all morning </s>
<s> Hot fiddlesticks ma Pearlie would say cheerily </s>
<s> It ain't hot because it's a gas stove </s>
<s> And I'll only get fat if I sit around </s>
<s> You put on your blackandwhite and go to church </s>
<s> Call me when you've got as far as your corsets and I'll puff your hair for you in the back </s>
<s> In her capacity of public stenographer at the Burke Hotel it was Pearlie's duty to take letters dictated by traveling men and beginning Yours of the 10th at hand </s>
<s> In reply would say . . . or Enclosed please find etc </s>
<s> As clinching proof of her plainness it may be stated that none of the traveling men not even Max Baum who was so fresh that the girl at the cigar counter actually had to squelch him ever called Pearlie baby doll or tried to make a date with her </s>
<s> Not that Pearlie would ever have allowed them to </s>
<s> But she never had had to reprove them </s>
<s> During pauses in dictation she had a way of peering nearsightedly over her glasses at the dapper welldressed traveling salesman who was rolling off the items on his sale bill </s>
<s> That is a trick which would make the prettiest kind of a girl look owlish </s>
<s> On the night that Sam Miller strolled up to talk to her Pearlie was working late </s>
<s> She had promised to get out a long and intricate bill for Max Baum who travels for Kuhn and Klingman so that he might take the nine o'clock evening train </s>
<s> The irrepressible Max had departed with much eclat and clatter and Pearlie was preparing to go home when Sam approached her </s>
<s> Sam had just come in from the Gayety Theatre across the street whither he had gone in a vain search for amusement after supper </s>
<s> He had come away in disgust </s>
<s> A soiled soubrette with orangecolored hair and baby socks had swept her practiced eye over the audience and attracted by Sam's goodlooking blond head in the second row had selected him as the target of her song </s>
<s> She had run up to the extreme edge of the footlights at the risk of teetering over and had informed Sam through the medium of songto the huge delight of the audience and to Sam's redfaced discomfiturethat she liked his smile and he was just her style and just as cute as he could be and just the boy for her </s>
<s> On reaching the chorus she had whipped out a small round mirror and assisted by the calciumlight man in the rear had thrown a wretched little spotlight on Sam's head </s>
<s> Ordinarily Sam would not have minded it </s>
<s> But that evening in the vest pocket just over the place where he supposed his heart to be reposed his girl's daily letter </s>
<s> They were to be married on Sam's return to New York from his first long trip </s>
<s> In the letter near his heart she had written prettily and seriously about traveling men and traveling men's wives and her little code for both </s>
<s> The fragrant girlish grave little letter had caused Sam to sour on the efforts of the soiled soubrette </s>
<s> As soon as possible he had fled up the aisle and across the street to the hotel writingroom </s>
<s> There he had spied Pearlie's goodhumored homely face and its contrast with the silly redandwhite countenance of the unlaundered soubrette had attracted his homesick heart </s>
<s> Pearlie had taken some letters from him earlier in the day </s>
<s> Now in his hunger for companionship he strolled up to her desk just as she was putting her typewriter to bed </s>
<s> Gee </s>
<s> This is a lonesome town </s>
<s> said Sam smiling down at her </s>
<s> Pearlie glanced up at him over her glasses </s>
<s> I guess you must be from New York she said </s>
<s> I've heard a real New Yorker can get bored in Paris </s>
<s> In New York the sky is bluer and the grass is greener and the girls are prettier and the steaks are thicker and the buildings are higher and the streets are wider and the air is finer than the sky or the grass or the girls or the steaks or the air of any place else in the world </s>
<s> Ain't they </s>
<s> Oh now protested Sam quit kiddin' me </s>
<s> You'd be lonesome for the little old town too if you'd been born and dragged up in it and hadn't seen it for four months </s>
<s> New to the road aren't you </s>
<s> asked Pearlie </s>
<s> Sam blushed a little </s>
<s> How did you know </s>
<s> Well you generally can tell </s>
<s> They don't know what to do with themselves evenings and they look rebellious when they go into the diningroom </s>
<s> The oldtimers just look resigned </s>
<s> You've picked up a thing or two around here haven't you </s>
<s> I wonder if the time will ever come when I'll look resigned to a hotel dinner after four months of 'em </s>
<s> Why girl I've got so I just eat the things that are covered uplike baked potatoes in the shell and soft boiled eggs and baked apples and oranges that I can peel and nuts </s>
<s> Why you poor kid breathed Pearlie her pale eyes fixed on him in motherly pity </s>
<s> You oughtn't to do that </s>
<s> You'll get so thin your girl won't know you </s>
<s> Sam looked up quickly </s>
<s> How in thunderation did you know </s>
<s> Pearlie was pinning on her hat and she spoke succinctly her hatpins between her teeth You've been here two days now and I notice you dictate all your letters except the longest one and you write that one off in a corner of the writingroom all by yourself with your cigar just glowing like a live coal and you squint up through the smoke and grin to yourself </s>
<s> Say would you mind if I walked home with you </s>
<s> asked Sam </s>
<s> If Pearlie was surprised she was woman enough not to show it </s>
<s> She picked up her gloves and handbag locked her drawer with a click and smiled her acquiescence </s>
<s> And when Pearlie smiled she was awful </s>
<s> It was a glorious evening in the early summer moonless velvety and warm </s>
<s> As they strolled homeward Sam told her all about the Girl as is the way of traveling men the world over </s>
<s> He told her about the tiny apartment they had taken and how he would be on the road only a couple of years more as this was just a tryout that the firm always insisted on </s>
<s> And they stopped under an arc light while Sam showed her the picture in his watch as is also the way of traveling men since time immemorial </s>
<s> Pearlie made an excellent listener </s>
<s> He was so boyish and so much in love and so pathetically eager to make good with the firm and so happy to have someone in whom to confide </s>
<s> But it's a dog's life after all reflected Sam again after the fashion of all traveling men </s>
<s> Any fellow on the road earns his salary these days you bet </s>
<s> I used to think it was all getting up when you felt like it and sitting in the big front window of the hotel smoking a cigar and watching the pretty girls go by </s>
<s> I wasn't wise to the packing and the unpacking and the rotten train service and the grouchy customers and the canceled bills and the grub </s>
<s> Pearlie nodded understandingly </s>
<s> A man told me once that twice a week regularly he dreamed of the way his wife cooked noodlesoup </s>
<s> My folks are German explained Sam </s>
<s> And my mothercan she cook </s>
<s> Well I just don't seem able to get her potato pancakes out of my mind </s>
<s> And her roast beef tasted and looked like roast beef and not like a wet red flannel rag </s>
<s> At this moment Pearlie was seized with a brilliant idea </s>
<s> Tomorrow's Sunday </s>
<s> You're going to Sunday here aren't you </s>
<s> Come over and eat your dinner with us </s>
<s> If you have forgotten the taste of real food I can give you a dinner that'll jog your memory </s>
<s> Oh really protested Sam </s>
<s> You're awfully good but I couldn't think of it </s>
<s> I You needn't be afraid </s>
<s> I'm not letting you in for anything </s>
<s> I may be homelier than an English suffragette and I know my lines are all bumps but there's one thing you can't take away from me and that's my cooking hand </s>
<s> I can cook boy in a way to make your mother's Sunday dinner with company expected look like Mrs. Newlywed's first attempt at `riz' biscuits </s>
<s> And I don't mean any disrespect to your mother when I say it </s>
<s> I'm going to have noodlesoup and fried chicken and hot biscuits and creamed beans from our own garden and strawberry shortcake with real Hush </s>
<s> shouted Sam </s>
<s> If I ain't there you'll know that I passed away during the night and you can telephone the clerk to break in my door </s>
<s> The Grim Reaper spared him and Sam came and was introduced to the family and ate </s>
<s> He put himself in a class with Dr. Johnson and Ben Brust and Gargantua only that his table manners were better </s>
<s> He almost forgot to talk during the soup and he came back three times for chicken and by the time the strawberry shortcake was half consumed he was looking at Pearlie with a sort of awe in his eyes </s>
<s> That night he came over to say goodby before taking his train out for Ishpeming </s>
<s> He and Pearlie strolled down as far as the park and back again </s>
<s> I didn't eat any supper said Sam </s>
<s> It would have been sacrilege after that dinner of yours </s>
<s> Honestly I don't know how to thank you being so good to a stranger like me </s>
<s> When I come back next trip I expect to have the Kid with me and I want her to meet you by George </s>
<s> She's a winner and a pippin but she wouldn't know whether a porterhouse was stewed or frapped </s>
<s> I'll tell her about you you bet </s>
<s> In the meantime if there's anything I can do for you I'm yours to command </s>
<s> Pearlie turned to him suddenly </s>
<s> You see that clump of thick shadows ahead of us where those big trees stand in front of our house </s>

<s> SCULL FIELD OF THE BUFFALO JONES AFRICAN EXPEDITION </s>
<s> III There was no use trying to avoid the fact any longer </s>
<s> The lions for the present had left the Sotik country and by remaining in camp at the Soda Swamp the Buffalo Jones Expedition was only wasting time </s>
<s> And time was precious thenwas growing more precious every dayif we expected to finish the work before the rains </s>
<s> The lion was the only big game we wanted now to complete the list of wild animals roped and tied and the lion was the most important of all </s>
<s> The expedition had traveled the long journey to the Sotik country especially to find them </s>
<s> Yet ever since the capture of the rhinoceros on the moving day of March 20th we had thoroughly swept the land in the vicinity of the Soda Swamp without finding even a single spoor </s>
<s> The blurred effect of the unique illustrations to this article is accounted for by the extreme difficulty of reproducing from a cinematograph film </s>
<s> It simply meant that the lions were not there </s>
<s> Some explanations were offered some arguments arose as to the whys and wherefores of this state of affairs </s>
<s> A few maintained that the lions had always been found there before it was strange they should have gone </s>
<s> A theory was advanced that the rains were late and the country was unusually dry so that the game had shifted to better pastures </s>
<s> Perhaps some water hole they depended on had failed </s>
<s> There is generally some discussion on such occasions </s>
<s> We had counted so much on the Sotik to give us our chance that the truth was hard to realize at first </s>
<s> But no matter what the cause might be we were finally forced to acknowledge the undeniable factthe lions had left the district </s>
<s> On the evening of March 25 the expedition faced the situation </s>
<s> As usual the night fell cold and when supper was finished the company collected about the fire that was burning close to the horses </s>
<s> A light wind stirred in the leaves overhead and the sky was full of stars </s>
<s> Here and there a tired horse was already half asleep and his head nodded gently in the firelight </s>
<s> From the darkness came the low talk of the saises rolled in their blankets on the ground at the end of the picket line </s>
<s> Most of the men stood with their backs to the flames gazing vacantly at the horses the trees or the stars </s>
<s> For a while not a word was said </s>
<s> Means threw another log on the fire and then squatted on his heels and silently watched the flames catch the bark and flare up brightly </s>
<s> As the heat increased Kearton took a step farther away and stood again </s>
<s> Every one knew that the Sotik had failed us and that it was time for us to go and so eventually when the Colonel spoke he only voiced the general conclusion </s>
<s> We've got to go back he said speaking straight in front of him at the nearest of the sleepy horses </s>
<s> We've got to go tomorrow and have a try from the water hole at the Rugged Rocks where we saw the two lions on the way out here </s>
<s> We may find one there and we may not </s>
<s> If we don't we've got to go on to Nairobi and start all over againprovided the rains don't begin </s>
<s> Accordingly through the long hot days the safari plodded back over the way we had come from the Soda Swamp to Agate's from Agate's to the Honeybird River and then on once more to the Last Water </s>
<s> The cameras were stowed away on the wagons the ropes remained coiled on the saddles for there was no probability of our finding lions on the way </s>
<s> And each man rode as his judgment decreed because the business of the safari then was to get on over the road and the oxwagons behind came along as best they could </s>
<s> For the most part it was a silent journey </s>
<s> The expedition had turned its back on the district that only a short week ago had held out such alluring promises and any day now the rains might commence effectually to put a stop to the work before it was done </s>
<s> Then tooalthough this may seem to be a small matter still it had weight with all of usthe white hunters of the country had ridiculed the idea of our being able to rope a lion and the prospect of returning and admitting defeat without having been given a proper chance was not pleasant to contemplate </s>
<s> At the Last Water we outspanned for the night and most of the succeeding day </s>
<s> In view of the situation the long halt was absolutely necessary to give the oxen a good rest and drink before setting forth on the twentyfourhour journey without water to the Rugged Rocks </s>
<s> But throughout the dragging hours of the enforced rest always there loomed ahead of us the possibility of failure and the need of haste </s>
<s> No mention was made of this openly </s>
<s> The only sign of our underlying anxiety was a vague restlessness pervading the entire safari </s>
<s> Once on the march again with the sun low in the west the restlessness disappeared </s>
<s> The night came dark because the moon rose late and the air was still so that the dust that lifted from beneath the feet of the oxen drifted along with the wagon </s>
<s> Now and again one of the wheels bumped over a rock in the road and the brake beam shook and rattled </s>
<s> At times the highpitched cries of the native drivers pierced the stillness </s>
<s> Ahead of us the bulk of the wagon load loomed big against the stars </s>
<s> When the dying moon first showed red through the branches of the twisted trees the safari crossed the top of the Mau and commenced the slow descent to the valley and the wagons in front became lost in the darkness and the dust </s>
<s> When the morning star rose we had come to the foothills of the escarpment and the dawn wind sprang up cold so that the men shivered a little in their saddles and buttoned up their coats and began to talk </s>
<s> It was just about here that we caught the giraffe that day said Kearton </s>
<s> Remember </s>
<s> And wasn't it hot </s>
<s> The talk drifted aimlessly round and about from the western ranches to Flicker Alley and the London Music Halls only to return in the end as it naturally would to the water hole at Rugged Rocks and our chances of finding lion </s>
<s> The discussion was lengthy on this pointit always was </s>
<s> By the time the sun came the expedition had entered the plain of the Rift Valley and with the rising of the sun the thirst began </s>
<s> Toward noon we halted for a couple of hours to allow the worst of the heat to pass over gave the horses and the porters a little of the water that was carried on one of the wagons and then inspanned again and went on </s>
<s> As the horsemen took the road the Colonel outlined his plan </s>
<s> We'll give the horses a good rest tonight for we ought to make camp early and then start hunting the first thing in the morning </s>
<s> We've got enough horsefeed to last us three or four days if the water holds out that long </s>
<s> In that time we ought to get a lion if there's any there </s>
<s> I'll ride on now a bit and look for signs </s>
<s> The Colonel's horse was a faster walker than the others and slowly he forged ahead </s>
<s> Little by little the safari began to string out along the road until wide spaces grew between the oxwagons with the porters straggling after them a mile behind </s>
<s> A change had come over the valley since we had seen it last </s>
<s> The land was whiter beneath the blazing sunshine and the dust lay thicker in the road </s>
<s> Somehow it seemed deserted </s>
<s> The only movement was the shimmer of the heat waves </s>
<s> The camera department had the slowest mounts and as the march had become a plodding procession in which the horses were allowed to choose their own paces one by one the other members of the expedition passed us </s>
<s> Loveless came from behind and rode with us for half a mile or so </s>
<s> I've been thinking this thing over he finally said and my idea is that after the dogs get the lion stopped one of us can go by him rope him and keep on going and then the other fellow can catch him by the hind legs and we've got him </s>
<s> If you keep on going fast enough I don't think he'll have a chance to spring at you </s>
<s> In the pause that followed the delivery of this opinion on a matter that had been thrashed out a hundred times before his horse gradually carried him farther ahead until he had gone beyond the range of talk </s>
<s> Ulyate the white hunter was the next </s>
<s> Kearton had just finished filling his pipe and he silently reached out the bag of tobacco </s>
<s> But Ulyate shook his head </s>
<s> Throat's too dry he said </s>
<s> But I want to be sure I understand what I've got to do </s>
<s> I'm to stand by to protect the cameras and leave the Colonel and the two boys to look after themselves </s>
<s> If the lion charges them I'm not to fireonly if he comes at the cameras </s>
<s> That's rightonly if he comes at the cameras </s>
<s> That's what I thought but I wanted to make sureIt's a likely place this Rugged Rocks he continued over his shoulder </s>
<s> We might easily find one tomorrow </s>
<s> Means on his big bay borrowed a drink of water from Gobbet's canteen and rode on after the others </s>
<s> The march of the safari grew slower and slower </s>
<s> The road was flat bending a little back and forth in long sweeping curves like a rope that was once taut and had been loosened </s>
<s> The native drivers no longer cried at the oxen for the beasts knew by instinct that they were traveling to water and could be relied upon to do their best and the men rode with their heads hung down watching the shadows of the horses on the road and hoping to see them lengthen </s>
<s> The Colonel the two cowboys and Ulyate reached the Rugged Rocks at least an hour ahead and when the rest of us came straggling in we found them seated on the ground with their backs to the bole of a tree </s>
<s> None of them looked up as we halted there dismounted and turned the horses loose </s>
<s> Then Ulyate spoke </s>
<s> Water hole has dried he said </s>
<s> There was nothing to be done about it </s>
<s> If the water hole had dried it had dried </s>
<s> That was all </s>
<s> And we had to push on to Kijabe </s>
<s> Lions or no lions there was no appeal from that decree </s>
<s> So we sat down with the others and watched the progress of the faroff dust cloud that marked the approaching wagons </s>
<s> Then when darkness came again the safari resumed the march </s>
<s> But the Colonel refused to abandon his former plan entirely without making at least one more attempt </s>
<s> Together with the two cowboys and Kearton he remained behind to scout at dawn the district between the Rugged Rocks and the railway </s>
<s> We might be able to tell if it's worth while to come back here he explained </s>
<s> It was nearly noon of the following day before the scouting party rejoined the expedition on the platform of the Kijabe station </s>
<s> The party reported that near the base of Longernot the northern volcano a belt of lava rock rises perpendicularly from the plain </s>
<s> Close to the southern end of this belt they had flushed two lions a male and a female and had kept sight of them for fully an hour </s>
<s> It was the opinion of all in the party that the lions lived in the neighborhood probably in the rocks </s>
<s> Very likely said Ulyate no one has ever hunted that corner of the valley </s>
<s> There is no water there </s>
<s> At first the Colonel was anxious to start back for them at once hauling the water with us but after a moment's reflection he was compelled to concede that it was time to call a halt </s>
<s> Means had strained his back again and could no longer sit straight in the saddle </s>
<s> An old thorn wound in Loveless's foot needed attention </s>
<s> Horses dogs and oxen were entirely fagged out </s>
<s> And besides the camera department demanded time to develop the earlier pictures already too long kept in the rolls </s>
<s> Of course as the Colonel maintained the rains might come and the chance be lost </s>
<s> Also the lions might not live in the rocks as we thought and tomorrow they might be gone </s>
<s> Better grab the opportunity while we have it he said </s>
<s> Look at the horses said Means </s>
<s> The Colonel walked deliberately along the platform to where the horses were tethered among the trees and stood there watching them for quite a while </s>
<s> You're right Means he said when he returned to us </s>
<s> They'll need at least four or five days before we can put them at a lionwell we've got to chance it </s>
<s> The next five days were the longest in the history of the expedition </s>
<s> The Colonel Means and Ulyate remained at Kijabe with the outfit </s>
<s> The rest of us traveled down the line to Nairobi to procure more porters more horsefeed and more supplies and every day we watched the weather closely and speculated on the probabilities of how long the lions would see fit to remain in the district </s>
<s> The time was so short that all other plans had been abandoned to take advantage of this one opportunitythe expedition was plunging so to speak on this final chance to succeed </s>
<s> But the weather held clear and in the meanwhile the preparations for this last attempt were pushed with the utmost speed </s>
<s> The hunters at Nairobi together with the storekeepers and farmers of the vicinity had heard of the capture of the rhino </s>
<s> On occasions some of them spoke of it to us </s>
<s> They explained that they had thought all along that we could undoubtedly rope a rhino </s>
<s> But you haven't got a lion yet have you </s>
<s> they said </s>
<s> On April 5 the preparations were nearly completed and Loveless's foot was nearly well </s>
<s> So we started up the line to rejoin the outfit leaving Gobbet at Nairobi to finish developing the films </s>
<s> We could not afford to spend more time in preparation </s>
<s> At Kijabe we found the horses thoroughly rested and Means's back much improved </s>
<s> He had refused to see a doctor asserting that his back would just naturally get better of its own accord </s>
<s> He said he was ready to start </s>
<s> With one exception the dogs were in good conditionold John from Arizona with his scars of many battles Rastus and The Rake taken from a pack of English foxhounds and Simba the terrier and the collie clipped like a lion from the London pound </s>
<s> Sounder the American bloodhound still showed some effects of distemper </s>
<s> But none of the dogs was to be left behind on this journey </s>
<s> That night the oxwagons were loadedone with provisions and camp baggage the other with drums of waterand when the dawn first began to break over the top of the range the expedition set forth from the station </s>
<s> The crater on Longernot had already caught the first rays of the sun when we reached the bottom of the hill and started across the flat land of the valley </s>
<s> There was no road leading to where we were going nor track nor path of any kind </s>
<s> No safari had ever gone there before </s>
<s> From the height of Kijabe station we had seen what looked to be a long low mound in the distant veldt </s>
<s> The southern end of that long low mound was our destination </s>
<s> The horsemen as usual spread out in a widely extended line and passed in front of the wagons and porters </s>
<s> As we penetrated farther into the valley the nature of the country altered </s>
<s> Open parks and stretches of scrub succeeded one another with here and there a dry donga cutting deep into the ground </s>
<s> As we approached the mound it rapidly grew in height and the black rocks commenced to appear beneath the covering of verdure </s>
<s> Among the settlers of the district this mound is called the Black Reef </s>
<s> It is the general opinion that the Black Reef is formed of lava that long ago flowed down into the plain from the crater of Longernot </s>
<s> The sides which rise almost perpendicularly to a height of some two hundred feet are composed of jagged blocks of stone honeycombed with deep caves and caverns </s>
<s> The top is covered with thick scrub and creepers and tall rank grasses </s>
<s> To the southward it ends abruptly as though the lava flow had suddenly stopped and cooled </s>
<s> Under the shadow of the Black Reef the hunting party was divided into three parts </s>
<s> The day was too far advanced for any real hunting to be done but as long as the light lasted the Colonel wanted to make a personal survey of the ground in the immediate vicinity of the rocks </s>
<s> Accordingly he rode to the northern end of the reef sending the two cowboys to the plains to the south while the rest remained where we had halted behind the southern shoulder to wait for the arrival of the wagons and make camp </s>
<s> But the only incident of the afternoon was a thunder cloud that rose up out of the north and hung there and then gradually disappeared as the twilight advanced </s>
<s> The others were late in coming in </s>
<s> The Colonel in the north had found tracksinnumerable tracks of different kinds of beastsall excepting those of the lion </s>
<s> In the south the two cowboys had found a large mixed herd of game and Loveless had dismounted to shoot for meat when out of the herd a rhino charged him and he had to kill it to save himself </s>
<s> Well so long as he's dead we'll let him lie where he is said the Colonel </s>
<s> Lions are mighty fond of rhino meat </s>
<s> They'll travel miles to get it </s>
<s> Day after tomorrow say just at dawn we ought to be able to pick up a fresh trail there </s>
<s> If we don't it will mean that the lions are no longer here that's all </s>
<s> Loveless grunted some unintelligible comment </s>
<s> Might as well be cheerful said Means </s>
<s> We're not beat yet </s>
<s> The first real hunting day commenced at daylight the next morning </s>
<s> Hour after hour the horsemen traveled the plains back and forth and across and around and carefully searched the base of the Black Reef on every side </s>
<s> Only one spot was left untouched </s>
<s> The Colonel decreed that no one should approach where the dead rhino lay lest our presence there should arouse suspicion too soon </s>
<s> The rhino was a sort of special chance that was to be saved for the proper time </s>
<s> The day was unusually still and cloudless </s>
<s> Here and there throughout the plains scattered herds of zebra hartebeests and gazelles grazed in peace </s>
<s> Not a spoor or a sign of lion was to be seen </s>
<s> For us the day was a blank and toward evening the thunder cloud rose again out of the north and again melted away into the twilight </s>
<s> The camp behind the shoulder of the Black Reef was a dry camp </s>
<s> Every drop of water had to be hauled in drums from Sewell's Farm </s>
<s> The oxwagon went in the morning and returned in the afternoon </s>
<s> In this way we could haul just enough water to last the outfit twentyfour hours </s>
<s> Special rules were inaugurated </s>
<s> Horses and dogs were given the preference always and one of the escaries was detailed to guard the drums </s>
<s> That night the wagon was long in returning from Sewell's </s>
<s> When it finally arrived the water in one of the drums had a strange taste </s>
<s> It's bad said Loveless </s>
<s> Immediately the affair assumed grave proportions </s>
<s> That particular drum became the most important object in camp </s>
<s> A feeling akin to personal animosity sprang up against it </s>
<s> For a time the merits and demerits of the case were seriously discussed and some of the porters gathered there and stared stupidly at the wagon load of water </s>
<s> I'll tell you what it is said Ulyate it's the weeds they've used as a stopper </s>
<s> The weeds in question were inspected closely and various judgments passed and some of the men were reminded of other times in other lands when the water had turned bad on their hands </s>
<s> Means drew a cupful and sipped deliberately </s>
<s> It might be the weeds he finally remarked </s>
<s> It's not really badonly tastes bad </s>
<s> So in the end we begged the question by setting the drum aside and deciding to use it only if we had to </s>
<s> But there were other matters to be determined that evening </s>
<s> In the Colonel's opinion the time had come for us to try to find a trail at the carcass of the rhino and the talk lasted far into the night </s>
<s> When finally evolved the plan of campaign was simple </s>
<s> It was arranged that the Colonel with the dogs should go to the southeast where the dead rhino lay the two cowboys should ride about two miles to the southwest and wait near the lower end of the big donga and Kearton Ulyate and myself should scale the southern face of the Black Reef where with the aid of glasses we could keep in touch with the Colonel and the boys on the plain below </s>
<s> Thus the men would be stationed at each corner of a vast triangle </s>
<s> If the Colonel flushed a lion the animal would probably break for either the rocks or the donga and so either the cowboys or the camera department could cut him off </s>
<s> Because the distances were so great the customary signal of two revolver shots to gather could not be relied upon the lighting of a fire would mean the same </s>
<s> The morning star was still bright in the eastern heavens when the expedition rode out of camp in the early hours of April 8th </s>
<s> At the end of half a mile the three parties gradually separated on slightly diverging lines and moved silently to their appointed stations </s>
<s> Leaving the horses and the camera porters at the base of the reef the three of us of the center station climbed the rocks in the darkness and waited for the dawn </s>
<s> Slowly the first signs of day appeared over the hills and the morning star commenced to fade </s>
<s> As the light strengthened the wide panorama of the plains and the far off mountains unfolded and the individual patches of scrub and single trees began to stand out distinctly from the general blur of the darker reaches </s>
<s> For fully half an hour everything was still and the light steadily broadened </s>
<s> Then suddenly Ulyate pointed </s>
<s> In the plain to the southeast we could see a black speck moving about in a strange mannerfirst one way then another then stopping and moving on again </s>
<s> It's the Colonel said Kearton who had the glasses </s>
<s> I think I can see the dogs </s>
<s> He's up to something </s>
<s> It was not many minutes before the Colonel's actions took on a different trend </s>
<s> For a space he rode straight for the reef </s>
<s> There the smaller black specks of the dogs appeared on the plain in front </s>
<s> No doubt remained now of what the Colonel was up to </s>
<s> The dogs were on the trail of some animallion or hyena there was no telling whichbut the scent was hot and the hunt was coming strong </s>
<s> At one place the dogs made a big bend to the north toward our camp </s>
<s> So the beast whatever it was had come to have a look at us in the night </s>
<s> For the first time then as they swung back for the rocks we faintly heard a hound give tongue </s>
<s> It was the only sound in the stillness </s>
<s> Kearton began tearing up the dry grass that grew in the cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap </s>
<s> Not yet said Ulyate wait till we're sure </s>
<s> On came the hunt following close to the southern base of the reef </s>
<s> The hounds could be heard giving tongue in turn now </s>
<s> The Colonel rode behind leaning forward and cheering on the dogs </s>
<s> He's made for the rocks all rightcome on said Ulyate as rifle in hand he started down the cliff </s>
<s> Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass and blew on it in his hurry and as the small flame sprang into life he threw on some green stuff and in a thin blue column the smoke rose up straight into the air </s>
<s> That will fetch the boys all right he said and we followed Ulyate down to the plain </s>
<s> Although the delay in lighting the fire was brief yet by the time we had reached the base and had mounted the horses the Colonel Ulyate and the dogs had already passed out of sight beyond a farther outjutting buttress of rock </s>
<s> We rounded the buttress only to find that the chase had vanished </s>
<s> The almost perpendicular wall of rocks was empty </s>
<s> There was a moment's halt </s>
<s> Then two quick shots rang out and at once there began a general chorus of baying yelping dogs intermingled with the deep heavy roar of a lion </s>
<s> The sounds came from somewhere in the thick growth on top of the Reef so we left the horses and climbed toward the sound </s>
<s> On the plateau the ground was covered with rugged lava blocks and the scrub and creepers were so dense that when Kearton shouted Ulyate's name the white hunter answered from not more than ten yards away </s>
<s> It's a lioness said Ulyate </s>
<s> The dogs have got her bayed </s>
<s> Look out </s>
<s> She's just on the other side of that bush </s>
<s> When I got here I found the Colonel seated on his horse facing the beast and trying to rope her </s>
<s> He didn't even have a knife on him </s>
<s> Why she didn't charge him I don't know </s>
<s> He couldn't get away over this kind of ground </s>
<s> He told me to call the others and so I fired </s>
<s> When the cowboys arrived from the distant donga they came threading their way toward us through the brush leading their horses </s>
<s> A short consultation was held </s>
<s> We've got to shift her said the Colonel </s>
<s> Can't do anything with her here </s>
<s> Bring the firecrackers </s>
<s> Bringthere she goes </s>
<s> The lioness had decided the issue and had bolted of her own accord </s>
<s> There was a streak of yellow through the bushes a scrambling of dogs wild frightened cries from the approaching camera porters and the hunt was on once more </s>
<s> The beast ran to an open cave at the edge of the plateau and crouched there facing the dogs </s>
<s> To maneuver the horses was absolutely out of the question so the lioness had to be shifted again </s>
<s> For upwards of two hours then by means of the dogs firecrackers and lighting the grass we drove her from one stronghold to another from crevasse to crevasse in trying to force her down off the reef </s>
<s> The sun rose and the heat commenced </s>
<s> The dogs were feeling the strain of the constant baying </s>
<s> One by one they would seek a spot of shade and lie panting there for a while and then return to the fray </s>
<s> Sounder being weak from distemper was the first to give out but he had done his share of the work </s>
<s> Porters were sent back to camp to bring water </s>
<s> Because the ground was bad and the beast was on the defensive photography was difficult but Kearton managed to catch small bits of action here and there with Ulyate standing by him </s>
<s> The day advanced and the dogs showed signs of tiring fast yet the lioness still clung to the stronghold of the rocks </s>
<s> Every means at hand to drive her into the open had been tried time and again without avail </s>
<s> The task began to look hopeless </s>
<s> We had already reached the stage when we saw our resources coming to an end </s>
<s> Get a pole said the Colonel and we'll poke a noose over her </s>
<s> It won't work said Loveless </s>
<s> We've tried that often enough to show it won't work </s>
<s> Just the same we'll try it again replied the Colonel </s>
<s> Loveless had just started to hunt for the pole when without warning the beast gave a quick savage snarl scattered the dogs from in front of her and dropping down the face of the reef to the plain below ran straight for the distant donga </s>
<s> Old John led the chase with the rest of the dogs trailing along as best they could and behind them the men and horses camera porters saises and dogboys went scrambling down the rocks in pursuit </s>
<s> On the bank of the donga the lioness stopped to fight the ropers </s>
<s> She had run far enough and meant business now and the hunt came up and halted a short distance away for a breathing spell </s>
<s> The lioness had taken up her position at the end of a short tongue of land projecting into the donga so that she was partially protected on three sides </s>
<s> The yelping dogs had quickly surrounded her but she paid little heed to them now </s>
<s> Crouched by the side of a small thorn bush she watched every move of the horsemen preparing to advance </s>
<s> Kearton mounted his camera at one side of the scene selecting his position with care to obtain the best background and general composition </s>
<s> He shifted about two or three times before he was satisfied </s>
<s> Of course there's no telling which way she's going to jump he explained </s>
<s> But we might as well get the beginning of it right </s>
<s> Means went first </s>
<s> Slowly he maneuvered toward her for a chance to throw his rope and the lioness alert opened her jaws and snarled at the horseman circling near </s>
<s> Closer and closer Means approached </s>
<s> Then all at once she charged </s>
<s> Means wheeled and spurred his horse to escape </s>
<s> For the first thirty yards of the race the lioness gained rapidly </s>
<s> Then the bay began to gather headway and slowly forged ahead </s>
<s> With a quick change of front the lioness turned and charged the Colonel who was sitting on his horse nearby </s>
<s> Again the lioness gained at first and again the horse drew away from her and so giving up the charge she returned to another thorn bush where she crouched down low and snarled and growled as before </s>
<s> And all the while Kearton on foot with his tripod was busy taking pictures of the show </s>
<s> This second position of hers gave the horsemen a better chance </s>
<s> There was now more room in which to get near her by a quick dash past the bush </s>
<s> While Means edged around on the northern side the Colonel moved to the south and by tossing his rope about and shouting he managed to attract and hold her attention </s>
<s> In fact he nearly succeeded too well for once she rose to the first spring of the charge and the Colonel half wheeled his horse for flight but the beast sank back again and glared at him </s>
<s> Then from behind her Means darted forward on the run swinging his rope free round and round his head </s>
<s> Kearton began shouting </s>
<s> Waitthe camera's jammed </s>
<s> Wait a bitshe's jammed here </s>
<s> But there was no stopping then and before the lioness knew what he was up to Means dashed by within a few feet of her and roped her round the neck </s>
<s> But a lioness's neck is short and thick and with a quick catlike twist she slipped the noose over her ears </s>
<s> Why can't they wait </s>
<s> complained Kearton </s>
<s> Somebody tell them to wait till I fix this </s>
<s> It's jammed </s>
<s> It must have got knocked on a rock somewhere </s>
<s> It never acted this way before </s>
<s> And all the while he talked his fingers were busy ripping out the jammed piece of film and loading up afresh </s>
<s> When he declared himself ready Loveless this time had already taken up his position to the north </s>
<s> Again the Colonel waved his rope and shouted and when the right moment came Loveless dashed past her and likewise roped her round the neck </s>
<s> Again the beast slipped the noose </s>
<s> Here a rather strange thing happened </s>
<s> We had been told on many occasions that in shooting lions the beast will give its attention to the man who has the rifle as if the instinct of the animal told it which man to fear </s>
<s> Up to this moment the lioness had held off the horsemen easily but no sooner had she freed herself from Loveless's rope than she fled into the donga and hid herself in a thicket of scrub and grass </s>
<s> For a time then it seemed that nothing would move her from out this scrub </s>
<s> The dogs were finished </s>
<s> Men and horses were becoming played out </s>
<s> Firecrackers and burning grass were used without result </s>
<s> Eventually the Colonel fastened a forked stick to his rope and dragged it across her hiding place to uncover her </s>
<s> This maneuver partly succeededsucceeded enough at least for Loveless to throw his rope at her </s>
<s> And at the sight of the rope coming toward her through the air she hurled herself at him like a flash so that it was only the side jump of his horse that saved him then she turned and broke away along the donga </s>
<s> At once Means was after her galloping hard for without the dogs there was danger of our losing sight of her </s>
<s> But the lioness did not run far </s>
<s> Her next and last position was in the bed of a small gully about three feet deep in the bottom of the donga and thickly grown with grasses </s>
<s> Here the ropers held a brief consultation and planned a final attempt </s>
<s> Loveless made a throw and the noose landed fairly above the beast's head but the thick grasses held it up </s>
<s> Loveless passed the other end of his rope over the branch of a nearby tree and down to the horn of his saddle </s>
<s> The rest of us with the cameras trained on the scene had no knowledge of the plan </s>
<s> We had not the slightest idea what the Colonel intended to do </s>
<s> Still wondering we watched him procure a long pole and ride quietly along the edge of the ditch toward the place where the lioness crouched </s>
<s> For a moment there was intense silence </s>
<s> The Colonel stopped his horse </s>
<s> Then leaning over from his saddle he poked the noose down through the grass </s>
<s> With a roar the beast sprang at himsprang through the loopand at the other end of the rope Loveless yanked quickly and caught her by the last hind leg going through </s>
<s> Putting spurs to his horse Loveless galloped away hauling the lioness back across the gully and up into the tree where she swung to and fro dangling by the one hind foot and snapping upward at the rope she could not reach </s>
<s> Got her </s>

<s> Now the rains can come when they like </s>
<s> The beast was furious </s>
<s> She was still swinging head down like a pendulum from the limb of the tree and was tossing her body about in frantic endeavor to get loose </s>
<s> Means approached close and deftly slipped a noose over one of the wildly gyrating forelegs </s>
<s> Leading his rope over the branch of another tree he stretched her out in a helpless position parallel with the ground </s>
<s> Now lower away on both lines said the Colonel </s>
<s> He dismounted and stood beneath her directing affairs as methodically as the foreman of a construction gang </s>
<s> Steady Meansa little more Lovelessnow togethereasy </s>
<s> She came within his reach and with a quick grab he caught and held her two hind legs with both hands while Kearton bound them together with a piece of light line </s>
<s> The rest was easy </s>
<s> In less than five minutes she was bound securely and lowered all the way to the ground to rest in the shade </s>
<s> It was nearly noon and time to call a halt to let the heat of the day pass over before attempting to bring her back to camp </s>
<s> Porters were sent to fetch food and more water horses were offsaddled and turned loose to graze and one by one the dogs came straggling in </s>
<s> The men stretched themselves out on the ground where a bush or a tree afforded some protection from the sun </s>
<s> But the Colonel kept wandering over to the prize to examine a knot to arrange a better shade or to pour the last drops of water from his canteen into her open mouth </s>
<s> Once he stood over her for a while watching her vain attempts to cut the ropes with her teeth </s>

<s> 6 THE WOMEN OF TOMORROW page 767777 part 4 </s>
<s> By WILLIAM HARD IV THE WASTERS It got talked around among Marie's friends that she didn't want children </s>
<s> This was considered very surprising in view of all that her father and husband had done for her </s>
<s> Here is what they had done for her They had removed from her life all need and finally all desire to make efforts and to accomplish results through struggle in defiance of difficulty and at the cost of pain </s>
<s> Work and pain were the two things Marie was on no account to be exposed to </s>
<s> With this small but important reservation she might work at avoiding pain </s>
<s> When the cook had a headache she took GettingBreakfast for it </s>
<s> When Marie had a headache she worked not at breakfast but at the headache </s>
<s> It was a social ceremony of large proportions with almost everybody among those present from the doctor down through Mother and Auntie to Little Sister </s>
<s> The decorations which were very elaborate comprised besides the usual tasteful arrangement of thermometers eaudeKarlsbad smellingsalts bottles cracked ice and chocolate creams a perfect shower of tourmaline roses the odor of which alone among all the vegetable odors in the world had been round after long experimentation to be soothing to Marie on such occasions </s>
<s> It was not thought that Marie could vanquish a headache except after a plucky fight of at least one day's duration </s>
<s> Actresses go on and do their turns day after day and night after night with hardly a miss </s>
<s> Marie's troubles were no more numerous than theirs </s>
<s> But they were much larger </s>
<s> Troubles are like gases </s>
<s> They expand to fill any void into which they are introduced </s>
<s> Marie's spread themselves through a vacuum as large as her life </s>
<s> The making of that vacuum and the inserting of Marie into it cost her father and her husband prodigious toil and was a great pleasure to them </s>
<s> Marie belonged to the Leisure Class </s>
<s> Socially she was therefore distinctly superior to her father and her husband </s>
<s> President Thomas of Bryn Mawr had Marie in mind when she said By the leisured class we mean in America the class whose men work harder than any other men in the excitement of professional and commercial rivalry but whose women constitute the only leisured class we have and the most leisured class in the world </s>
<s> Marie's father wasn't so very rich either </s>
<s> He was engaged in a business so vividly competitive that Marie's brother was hurried through college as fast as possible and brought into the game at twentytwo with every nerve stretched taut </s>
<s> Nothing like that was expected of Marie </s>
<s> She was brought up to think that leisure was woman's natural estate </s>
<s> Work for any girl she regarded as an accident due to the unexpected and usually reprehensible collapse of the males of the poor girl's family </s>
<s> This view of the matter gave Marie UNCONSCIOUSLY TO HERSELF what morality she had </s>
<s> Hard drinking illegitimate gambling and excessive dissipations of all sorts are observed commonly to have a prejudicial effect on male efficiency and family prosperity </s>
<s> Against all vices therefore although she didn't catch the therefore Marie was a Moral Force of a million angelpower </s>
<s> Aside from vices however all kinds of conduct looked much alike to her </s>
<s> Ethics is the rules of the game the decencies of the struggle for existence </s>
<s> Marie had no part in the struggle </s>
<s> She violated its decencies without being at all aware of it </s>
<s> All the way for instance from stealing a place in the line in front of a boxoffice window ahead of ten persons who were there before her up the tiny scale of petty aggressions within her narrow reach to the cool climax of spending three months every summer in a pinewood mountain resort thus depriving her citybound husband of the personal companionship which was the one best thing she had to give him in return for what he gave her she was as competent a little grafter as the town afforded </s>
<s> But she was a perfectly logical one </s>
<s> Her family had trained her to deadhead her way through life and she did it </s>
<s> Finally she went beyond their expectations </s>
<s> They hadn't quite anticipated all of the sweetly undeviating inertia of her mind </s>
<s> Nevertheless she was a nice girl </s>
<s> In fact she was The Nice Girl </s>
<s> She was sweettempered sweetmannered and sweetspokena perfect dear </s>
<s> She never did a bad thing in her life </s>
<s> And she never ceased from her career of moral forcing </s>
<s> She wrote to her husband from her mountain fastness warning him against highballs in hot weather </s>
<s> She went twice a month during the winter to act as librarian for an evening at a settlement in a district which was inhabited by perfectly respectable working people but which while she passed out the books she sympathetically alluded to as a slum </s>
<s> It is hardly fair however to lay the whole explanation of Marie on her father her husband and herself </s>
<s> A few years ago in the churchyard of St. Philip's Church at Birmingham they set up a tombstone which had fallen down and they reinscribed it in honor of the longneglected memory of the man who had been resting beneath it for a century and a half </s>
<s> His name was Wyatt </s>
<s> John Wyatt </s>
<s> He had a good deal to do with making Marie what she was </s>
<s> What toil what tossing nights what sweating days what agonized wrenching of the imagination toward a still unreached idea have gone into the making of leisurefor other people </s>
<s> Wyatt strained toward and touched the idea which was the real start of modern leisure </s>
<s> In the year 1733 coming from the cathedral town of Lichfield where the Middle Ages still lingered he set up in a small building near Sutton Coldfields a certain machine </s>
<s> That machine inaugurated and forever symbolizes the long and glorious series of mechanical triumphs which has made a large degree of leisure possible not for a few thousand women as was previously the case but for millions and millions of them </s>
<s> It was only about two feet square </s>
<s> But it accomplished a thing never before accomplished </s>
<s> It spun the first thread ever spun in the history of the world without the intervention of human fingers </s>
<s> On that night woman lost her oldest and most significant title and function </s>
<s> The Spinster ceased to be </s>
<s> The mistress and her maid spinning together in the Hall their fingers drawing the roving from the distaff and stretching it out as the spindle twisted it were finally on the point of separating forever </s>
<s> We all see what Wyatt's machine did to the maids </s>
<s> We all understand that when he started his mill at Birmingham and hired his working force of TEN GIRLS he prophesied the factory slum </s>
<s> We do not yet realize what he did to the mistresses how he utterly changed their character and how he marvelously increased their number </s>
<s> But look </s>
<s> His machine with the countless machines which followed it in the spinning industry and in all other industries made it possible to organize masses of individuals into industrial regiments which required captains and majors and colonels and generals </s>
<s> It created the need of leadership of MULTITUDINOUS leadership </s>
<s> And with leadership came the rewards of leadership </s>
<s> And the wives and daughters of the leaders a race of men previously by comparison nonexistent arose in thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions to live in leisure and semileisure on the fruits of the new system </s>
<s> While the maids went to the slums the mistresses went to the suburbs </s>
<s> Looking at it in that way one sometimes doesn't feel so sorry for the maids </s>
<s> What did Wyatt get out of it </s>
<s> Imprisonment for debt and the buzz of antiquarians above his rotted corpse </s>
<s> Wyatt and his equally humble successors in genius Hargreaves and Crompton artisans </s>
<s> Where in history shall we find men the world took more from gave less to </s>
<s> To Hargreaves inventing the spinning jenny a mob and a flight from Lancashire a wrecked machine and a sacked house </s>
<s> To Crompton inventing the spinningmule which in simulating surpassed the delicate pulling motion of the spinster's armto Crompton poverty so complete that the mule patient bearer of innumerable fortunes to investors was surrendered to them unpatented while its maker retired to his HallintheWood and his workman wages </s>
<s> Little did Wyatt and Hargreaves and Crompton eat of the bread of idleness they built the oven for </s>
<s> But Arkwright </s>
<s> There was the man who foreshadowed in his own career the new aristocracy about to be evoked by the new machinery </s>
<s> He made spinning devices of his own </s>
<s> He used everybody else's devices </s>
<s> He patented them all </s>
<s> He lied in the patents </s>
<s> He sued infringers of them </s>
<s> He overlooked his defeats in the courts </s>
<s> He bit and gouged and endured and invented and organized till from being a barber and dealing in hairdyes and bargaining for the curls of pretty girls at country fairs he ended up Sir Richard Arkwright andlast perfect touch in a fighting careerwas building a church when he died </s>
<s> And his son was England's richest commoner </s>
<s> It was the dawn of the day of common richness </s>
<s> The new aristocracy was as hospitably large as the old aristocracy had been sternly small </s>
<s> Before Wyatt leisure had been the thinnest of exhalations along the very top of society </s>
<s> Since Wyatt it has got diffused in greater and greater density through at least the upper third of it </s>
<s> And for all that magical extension of free time wrested from the ceaseless toil with which God cursed Adam we stand indebted and so recently </s>
<s> to the machinery SET going by that spontaneous explosion of artisan genius in England only a hundred and fifty years ago KEPT going and faster and faster by the labor of men women and children behind factory windows the world over today </s>
<s> Marie's view of the situation however is the usual one </s>
<s> We are billions of miles from really realizing that leisure is produced by somebody's work that just Being a Good Woman or Being a Decent Fellow is so far from being an adequate return for the toil of other people that it is just exactly no return at all </s>
<s> We are billions of miles from admitting that the virtuous parasite is just as much a parasite as the vicious parasitethat the former differs from the latter in the use of the money but not at all in the matter of getting it in return for nothing </s>
<s> To get something for nothing is the fundamental immorality in the world </s>
<s> But we don't believe it </s>
<s> There will be a revolution before we get it into our heads that trying to trade a sweet disposition or an intelligent appreciation of opera or a proficiency at amateur tennis for three meals a day is a fraud </s>
<s> Marie didn't mean to commit a fraud </s>
<s> She just dropped a sentimental nonnegotiable plugged nickel into the slotmachine of life and drew out a motor car and a country place and was innocently pleased </s>
<s> Such a wonderful slotmachine </s>
<s> She never saw the laboring multitudes behind it past and present multitudes dead fingers living fingers big men's fingers little children's fingers pulling the strings delivering the prizes laying aside the plugged nickel in the treasury of a remote revenge </s>
<s> Perhaps the reason why she didn't catch on to the fact that instead of being the world's creditor she was really inhabiting an almshouse was that she was so busy </s>
<s> You see she not only did things all the time but she had to find and invent them to do </s>
<s> Her life even before she was married was much more difficult than her brother's who simply got up in the morning and took the same old 742 to the same old office </s>
<s> When he wanted clothes he went to the nearest decent tailor </s>
<s> No such cinch for Marie </s>
<s> Her tailor lived in Sutherton on the directly opposite side of the city from the suburb in which Marie lived </s>
<s> Just to get to that tailor's cost Marie an hour and a half of effort </s>
<s> She had got up early but by the time the tailor had stuck the world's visible supply of pins into the lines of her new coat most of the forenoon had been arduously occupied </s>
<s> Of course many forenoons had to be thus occupied </s>
<s> Never forget it </s>
<s> The modish adaptation of woven fabrics to the female contour becomes increasingly complex and minute and exacting and timeoccupying in precise proportion as the amount of time increases for which occupation must be devised </s>
<s> Besides it gives employment to the tailors </s>
<s> This is the really meritorious function of the leisure class </s>
<s> It gives employment </s>
<s> And every extension of its tastes and needs gives more employment </s>
<s> Marie and her friends greatly increased the number and prosperity of tailors and milliners and candydippers and perfumemanufacturers and manicurists and hairdressers and plumedbird hunters and florists and cabdrivers and Irish lacemakers and Chinese silkworm tenders and violetandorris sachetpowder makers and matinee heroes and French nuns who embroider underwear and furtraders and pearldivers and other deserving persons not forgetting the multitudes of Turks who must make nougat or perish </s>
<s> In fact Marie and her friends in the course of a year gave as much employment as a fairsized earthquake </s>
<s> That is in the course of a year they destroyed without return a large amount of wealth and set many people to work replacing it </s>
<s> If we had a large enough leisure class we should have no need of fires and railroad wrecks and the other valuable events which increase our prosperity by consuming it </s>
<s> Marie belonged to the real Consumers' League </s>
<s> And she consumed prettily and virtuously </s>
<s> It wasn't bad air that suffocated her soul </s>
<s> It was no air </s>
<s> She thought she was breathing however and breathing fast </s>
<s> Why it was halfpast eleven before she got back downtown from her tailor and she bought a wedding present till one and she was just famished and ran to a tearoom but she had hardly touched a mouthful when she remembered there was a girl from out of town who had come in to spend a month doing nothing and had to be helped but though she rushed to the 'phone she couldn't get her friend before it was time to catch her suburban train home in order to do which she jumped into the station 'bus only to remember she had forgotten to buy a ribbon for her Siamese costume for the Benefit Ball but it was too late now and she spent her time going out on the train trying to think of some way of getting along without it and her head began to ache but luckily she met some of the girls on her way from the station to her highschool sorority alumnae reunion and they began to tell her how to do it but she had to hurry away because she had promised to go to the house of one of the girls and do stencil patterns which started to be beautiful but before she could get any of them really done she recollected that Chunk Brown had sent over a bunch of new songs and was coming to call tonight and she had to scoot home and practice June time is moon time and tune time and spoon time as well as The grass is blue o'er little Sue till there was just one hour left before dinner and she was perfectly crazy over the new do which one of the girls had showed her and she rushed upstairs and went at that do and by dinner time she had got it almost right so that Father told her always to do her hair like that and Brother wished he had it down at the factory to replace a broken dynamo brush while as for Chunk he was nicer than ever till he learned he had to take her to a rehearsal of the Siamese Group for the Benefit Ball so that what with having to coax him to go and what with changing into her costume she got to the rehearsal so tired she couldn't stand up to go through the figures till she caught sight of the celebrated esthete the Swami Ram Chandra Gunga Din who was there to hand out the right slants about oriental effects and who had persuaded Marie there was great consolation to be found in realizing that life is a spiral and that therefore you can't make progress straight up but must go round and round through rhythmic alternations of joy and sorrow which caused Chunk to relapse again from his attentiveness but which pleased Marie greatly because she was always unhappy in between two periods of happiness and therefore felt she was getting along the spiral and into Culture pretty well till it was eleven o'clock and she waked Chunk up out of a chair in the hall and made him take her home and he said the Swami was a VERY CLEVER man and she said American men had no culture and didn't understand women and Chunk didn't even say goodnight to her and she went to sleep crying and remembering she hadn't after all learned from the girls how to get along without that ribbon in her costume and she must get up early and buy it which made her utter one final little plaintive sniffle of vexation </s>
<s> It was a nice child's life full of small things which looked big uncorrected in its view of Love Culture Charity or anything else by any carrying of the burdens enduring of the shocks or thrilling to the triumphs of a really adult life </s>
<s> Her brother when he went to work was her junior </s>
<s> In five years he was much her senior </s>
<s> You may verify this by observations among your own acquaintances </s>
<s> Marie was not a minute older now than when she left school </s>
<s> Talking to her at twentysix was exactly the same experience as talking to her at twentyone </s>
<s> That was what the world from John Wyatt to her father had done for her </s>
<s> From such a life there are necessarily revulsions </s>
<s> The empty leisure of the Nice Girl is quite successfully total waste </s>
<s> But it becomes intolerable to that waster who though not desiring genuine occupation desires genuine sensation </s>
<s> Hence smart sets </s>
<s> Every social group in which there is much leisure has its own smart set </s>
<s> There may be a million dollars a year to spend </s>
<s> There may be only a few thousands </s>
<s> But there is always a smart set </s>
<s> How suddenly its smartness may follow its leisure how accurately its plunge into luxury may duplicate the suddenness of modern luxury itself you may observe with your own eyes almost anywhere </s>
<s> You see a little crowd of women come into the Mandarin Tea Room of the St. DuBarry in Novellapolis in the fresh West </s>
<s> When they remove their automobile veils you see that they were once and very recently the nicest sort of members of the sewing circle and the W </s>

<s> When the waiter comes along with their cocktails and they begin to sip them out of their teacups you wake up with a jerk to realize that it's halfpast three in the afternoon and the evening has begun </s>
<s> How rapid it all is </s>
<s> There's Margaret Simpson </s>
<s> A few years ago you might have seen her pumping the water for Jim's breakfast cleaning the lamps and picking bugs off the potato vines </s>
<s> Jim came to town </s>
<s> He struck it poor </s>
<s> Then he struck it rich </s>
<s> He owns a bunch of movingpicture places </s>
<s> He manufactures a patented bottlestopper </s>
<s> He's a pavement contractor </s>
<s> His wife has just as much leisure as any duchess </s>
<s> The duchess has her individual estate and resources which make it possible for her to lead an almost complete social life within her own walls </s>
<s> But never mind </s>
<s> Margaret has the Downtown District cooperatively owned cooperatively maintained magnificently equipped with bright boudoirs in the restrooms of the department stores with wonderful conservatories where one may enter and gaze and pay no more attention to the florist than to one's own gardener with sumptuous drawingrooms like the Purple Parlor of the St. DuBarry with bodyservants in the beautyshops with coachmen on the taxicabs with seclusion in the Ladies' Department of the Novellapolis Athletic Cluban infinitely resourceful estate which Margaret knows as intimately as the duchess knows hers </s>
<s> This morning she hunted down a new reduction plant on the eighteenth floor of the Beauty Block and weighed in at 185 on the white enamel scales and after an hour of ThermoVibroMagnetoMagentaEdisonCompanylighttherapy weighed out at 1826 </s>
<s> At luncheon she ate only puree of tomatoes creamed chickenandsweetbreads Boston brown bread and butter orange punch and Lady Baltimore cake severely cutting out the potatoes </s>
<s> After luncheon she spent an hour in a tiny room which had mirrors all around it and a maid as trim and Frenchaccented as any maid any duchess could have and a couple of fitters and a head fitter </s>
<s> It ended up with Do you mean to tell me that after all the reducing and dieting I've been doing I can't wear under a twentyseven </s>
<s> It's ridiculous </s>
<s> I tell you what </s>
<s> Measure me for a madetoorder </s>
<s> These stock sizes all run large </s>
<s> If it's madetoorder I can wear a twentysix as easy as anybody </s>
<s> Then she met up with her friends at the St. DuBarry </s>
<s> You watch the waiter bring another round of drinks and you perceive that the evening is well under way and that the peak of the twentyfour hours is being disputatiously approached </s>
<s> It appears that Perinique's is a swell place to dine but that the cheese is bad </s>
<s> The cheese is good right here at the St. DuBarry but they don't know how to toast the biscuits </s>
<s> At the Grunewurst the waiters are poor </s>
<s> At Max's the soup is always cold </s>
<s> The mural decorations at the Prince Eitel are so gloomy they give you a chill </s>
<s> Despair settles down on the scene </s>
<s> There seems to be no likelihood that there will be any dinner at all anywhere </s>
<s> A ray of light penetrates with the inquiry whether you saw the way Jim looked at Dora last night </s>
<s> If _I_ was you Margaret and MY husband looked at Dora like that _I_ </s>
<s> . . No wonder Dora's husband divorced her </s>
<s> . . . The trouble with Margaret is she's too good to Jim </s>
<s> If she had any sense she could make him so jealous he'd stand on his head for her </s>
<s> . . . Why don't you tell Ned to cut in there and pay a little attention to Marge </s>
<s> . . . Oh Ned's no good </s>
<s> . . . Well I'll tell MY HUSBAND </s>
<s> . . Don't you do it I started my husband once on a thing like that and he </s>

<s> He's got an engagement for tonight </s>
<s> . . . Say here's Dora now </s>
<s> Dora Got to sweep right along </s>
<s> Goin' to buzz out to the Inland Inn for dinner with Ned </s>

<s> Jim asks where Dora is </s>
<s> Loud chorus tells him </s>
<s> Details of Dora's divorce begin to fly about </s>
<s> Harry orders a round of drinks </s>
<s> Somebody praises the drawn butter sauce at the Suddington </s>
<s> This is met with the merits of the pineapple parfait at the La Fontaine </s>
<s> Jim thinks Dora's divorce was her husband's fault </s>
<s> Margaret gets up and goes back to the Purple Parlor and cries </s>
<s> Bessie begins to tell Jim how attentive Ned is to Margaret </s>
<s> This is so helpful that Jim gets up to find Margaret and tell her what he thinks of her </s>
<s> Finds her crying and thinks she is crying because Ned is away with Dora </s>
<s> Terrible row in Purple Parlor </s>
<s> Bessie starts in to explain </s>
<s> Everybody stands about in couples explaining </s>
<s> Waiter runs around trying to find gen'l'man to pay for undrunk drinks </s>
<s> Poor Frank being the only member of the party who hasn't been drinking is so sober that he pays </s>
<s> He finally corrals the whole crowd into a couple of taxicabs </s>
<s> They go down the street with everybody's head out of the cabwindow and everybody's voice saying The Suddington The Grunewurst Max's The Royal Gorge Perinique's </s>
<s> The revulsion from empty leisure in the direction of fulleverynight leisure is balanced to some extent by a revulsion toward activity of a useful sort </s>
<s> This latter revulsion has two phases Economic Independence which has been spoken of in former articles Social Service and Citizenship which will be spoken of next month </s>
<s> Which one of these two revulsions will be the stronger </s>
<s> If it is the one toward useful activity we shall see a dam erected against the current which in carrying women out of the struggle for existence carries them out of the world's mental strife </s>
<s> If it is the one toward frivolity we shall see simply an acceleration of that current and a quicker and larger departure from all those habits of toil and service which produce power and character </s>
<s> With marriage of course Marie had a certain opportunity to get back into life </s>
<s> She had before her at least fifteen years of real work </s>
<s> And it would have been work of the realest sort </s>
<s> Effortto and beyond all other effort </s>
<s> The carrying of new life in fear the delivery of it in torture the nourishing of it in relinquishment f all the world's worldliness the watching over it in sleeplessness the healing of its sickness in heartsickness the bringing of it with its body strong its mind matured up into the world of adults up into the struggle for existence </s>
<s> What a work </s>
<s> But what a preparation for it had Marie </s>
<s> She flinched from it </s>
<s> The inertia of her mind carried her to the ultimate logic of her life </s>
<s> Along about the time of her marriage she began to cease to be the typical normal girl of her type </s>
<s> She became a woman of the futureOF HER TYPE </s>
<s> From the facts of modern idleness the positive character reacts toward newfound activity toward an enormous neverbeforewitnessed expenditure of intelligent care on children toward selfsupport toward civic service </s>
<s> The character which is neither positive nor negative runs along as a neutral mixture of modern facts and of old ideals of casual idling and of casual childrearing </s>
<s> The negative characterlike Marie'sjust yields to the facts and is swept along by them into final irresponsibility and inutility </s>
<s> Marie wasn't negative enoughshe wasn't positive enough in her negativenessto plunge into dissipation </s>
<s> It wasn't in her nature to do any plunging of any kind </s>
<s> Good safe motionless sponging was her instinct </s>
<s> And she will die in the odor of tubbed and scrubbed respectability </s>
<s> And if you knew her you would like her very much </s>
<s> She is charming </s>
<s> When she and Chunk were married they went to live in an apartment appropriate to a rising young man and Marie's job was on all occasions to look as appropriate as the apartment </s>
<s> No shallow cynicism this </s>
<s> Just plain bald truth without any wig on it </s>
<s> The only thing that you could put your finger on that Marie really did was so to wear clothes and so to give parties as to be the barometer of her husband's prosperity </s>
<s> And in every city you can see lots of such barometers giving themselves an artificially high reading in order to create that atmosphere of success which is a recognized commercial asset </s>
<s> Chunk was hugely pleased with Marie </s>
<s> She looked good at the dinnertable in the cafe of their apartment building </s>
<s> She knew how to order the right dishes when they entertained and dined downtown </s>
<s> She made it possible for him to return deftly and engagingly the social attentions of older people </s>
<s> She completed the front of his life and he not only supported her but as Miss Salmon of Vassar flippantly and seriously says he sported her as he might a diamond shirt stud </s>
<s> No struggle in Marie's life so far </s>
<s> No HAVING to swim in the cold water of daily enforced duty or else sink </s>
<s> NO BEING ACCUSTOMED TO THE DISAGREEABLE FEEL OF THAT WATER </s>
<s> She had missed work </s>
<s> That was nothing </s>
<s> She had missed being HARDENED to work </s>
<s> That was everything </s>
<s> The first demand ever made on her for really disagreeable effort came when Chunk in order to get a new factory going had to move for a while to Junction City </s>
<s> When Marie bitterly and furiously objected Chunk was severely astonished </s>
<s> Why he had to go </s>
<s> It was necessary </s>
<s> But there had been no necessity in Marie's experience </s>
<s> They became quarrelsome about it </s>
<s> Then stubborn </s>
<s> Marie talked about her mother and her friends and how she loved them which was true and stayed </s>
<s> For two years she inhabited Chunk's flat in the city and lived on Chunk's monthly check </s>
<s> She and Chunk were married </s>
<s> Chunk was to support her </s>
<s> Her father used to support her </s>
<s> Her job then was being nice </s>
<s> That was her job now </s>
<s> And she was nice </s>
<s> And she was still supported </s>
<s> Perfectly logical </s>
<s> For two years neither really daughter now nor really wife not being obliged any longer even to make suggestions to her mother about what to have for dinner not being obliged any longer even to think out the parties for Chunk's business friends she did nothing but become more and more firmly fixed in her inertia in her incapacity for hardship in her horror of pain </s>
<s> When Chunk came back from Junction City and was really convinced that she didn't want children he was not merely astonished </s>
<s> He thought the world had capsized </s>
<s> In a way he was right </s>
<s> The world is turning round and over and back to that one previous historical era when the aversion to childbearing was widespread </s>
<s> Once just once before our time there was a modern world </s>
<s> Once just once though not on the scale we know it there was before us a diffusion of leisure </s>
<s> The causes were similar </s>
<s> The Romans conquered the world by military force just as we have conquered it by mechanical invention </s>
<s> They lived on the plunder of despoiled peoples just as we live on the products of exploited continents </s>
<s> They had slaves in multitudes just as we have machines in masses </s>
<s> Because of the slaves there were hundreds of thousands of their women in the times of the Empire who had only denatured housekeeping to do just as today there are millions of our women who because of machines have only that kind of housekeeping to do </s>
<s> Along with leisure and semileisure they acquired its consequences just as we have acquired them </s>
<s> And the sermons of Augustus Caesar first hero of their completed modernity against childlessness are perfect precedents for those of Theodore Roosevelt first hero of ours </s>
<s> Augustus however addressed himself mainly to the men who entered into marriage late or did not enter into it at all for reasons identical with oursthe increased competitiveness of the modern life and the decreased usefulness of the modern wife </s>
<s> It was the satirists who addressed themselves particularly to the women </s>
<s> And their tirades against idleness frivolity luxury dissipation divorce and aversion to childbearing leave nothing to be desired in comparison with modern efforts for effectiveness in rhetoricor for ineffectiveness in result </s>
<s> Now it could not have been the woman who desires economic independence through selfsupport who was responsible for the ultimate aversion to childbearing in the Roman worldfor SHE did not exist </s>
<s> It could not have been the woman who desires full citizenshipfor she did not exist </s>
<s> What economic power and what political power the Roman Empire woman desired and achieved was parasiticthe economic power which comes from the inheritance of estates the political power which comes from the exercise of sexual charm </s>
<s> The one essential difference between the women of that ancient modern world and the women of this contemporary modern world is in the emergence along with really democratic ideals of the agitation for equal economic and political opportunity </s>
<s> The other kind of New Woman the woman brought up throughout her girlhood in a home in which there is no adequate employment for her trained to no tasks or at any rate to tasks like dusting the diningroom and counting the laundry so petty so ridiculously irrelevant that her greatgrandmother did them in the intervals of her real work going then into marriage with none of the discipline of habitual encounter with inescapable toil taken by her husband not to share his struggle but his prosperitythat sort of New Woman they had just as we have her in smaller number it is true but in identical character </s>
<s> They tell us it was luxury that ruined the Romans </s>
<s> But was luxury the START </s>
<s> Wasn't it only the means to the FINISH </s>
<s> Eating a grouse destroys in itself no more moral fiber than eating a ham sandwich </s>
<s> Bismarck whether he slept on eiderdown or on straw arose Bismarck </s>
<s> The person who has a job and who does it is very considerably immunized against the consequences of luxury </s>
<s> First because he is giving a return for it </s>
<s> Second because he hasn't much time for it </s>
<s> On the other hand we see the hobo who won't work ruining himself on the luxury of stablefloors and of freelunch counters just as thoroughly as any nobleman who won't work can ever ruin himself on the luxury of castles and game preserves </s>
<s> It is clearly the habitual enjoyment of either grouse or ham sandwiches of either eiderdown or straw WITHOUT SERVICE RENDERED AND WITHOUT FATIGUE ENDURED that ultimately desiccates the moral character and drains it of all capacity for effort </s>
<s> Marie was as reasonable a proposition as that two and two make four </s>
<s> She had given her early plastic formative years to acquiring the HABIT of effortless enjoyment and when the time for making an effort came the effort just wasn't in her </s>
<s> Her complete withdrawal from the struggle for existence had at last in her negative nonresistive mind atrophied all the instincts of that struggle including finally the instinct for reproduction </s>
<s> The instinct for reproduction is intricately involved in the struggle for existence </s>
<s> The individual struggles for perpetuation for perpetuation in person for perpetuation in posterity </s>
<s> Work the perpetuation of one's own life in strain and pain work the clinging to existence in spite of its blows work the inuring of the individual to the penalties of existence is linked psychologically to the power and desire for continued racial life </s>
<s> The individual the class which struggles no more will in the end reproduce itself no more </s>
<s> In not having had to conquer life it has lost its will to live </s>
<s> The detailed daily reasons for this ultimate social law stand clear in Marie's life </s>
<s> And remember what sort of woman she was </s>
<s> The woman who is coerced by external authoritative ideals will bear children even when the wish to bear them is really absent </s>
<s> She will bear them without thinking </s>
<s> She will bear them because she has never thought that anything else was possible </s>
<s> But Marie and this means millions of women throughout the modern world was free wonderfully unparalleledly free </s>
<s> She was free though a leisured woman from the requirement of an heir for a great family estate </s>
<s> She was free from the dictates of historic Christianity about conjugal duty and unrestricted reproduction </s>
<s> She was free from the old uncomplaining compliance with a husband's will </s>
<s> Modern life had done all this for her </s>
<s> She was uncoerced by family authority ecclesiastical authority or marital authority </s>
<s> She was limitlessly free limitlessly irresponsible a creature of infinite opportunities and no duties </s>
<s> All social coercion toward childbearing having been withdrawn from her the only guide she had left and it would have been her best one was instinct and impulse </s>
<s> But with the cessation from struggle with the cessation from effort and from fatigue and from discipline and from the sorrow of pain that brings the joy of accomplishment that instinct and impulse had disappeared </s>
<s> With the petrifaction of its soil it had withered away </s>
<s> She had been sedulously trained to sterility </s>
<s> Nevertheless when it got talked around among her friends that she didn't want children everybody thought it very surprising in view of all that had been done for her </s>

<s> 6 THE MAN WHO MADE GOOD pages 784799 By ARTHUR STRINGER AUTHOR OF THE SILVER POPPY PHANTOM HOUSE ETC </s>
<s> Trotter opened his door and listened </s>
<s> Then he tiptoed out to the stairhead </s>
<s> The coast seemed clear </s>
<s> The house lay beneath him as still as a well </s>
<s> It was nothing more than a threetiered cavern of quietness </s>
<s> So he crept back to his own room and closed and locked the door after him </s>
<s> It was a topfloor rear where a hiproof gave his back wall the rake of a Baltimore buckeye and a dismantled electric callbell bore ignominious testimony to the fact that his skyey abode had once been a servant's quarters </s>
<s> But the room was quiet and what counted more it was cheap </s>
<s> The thought of ever being put out of it terrified the frugalminded Trotter </s>
<s> For seven weary months he had wandered about New York's skyline looking for just the right corner as peevish as a cowbird looking for a copse nest </s>
<s> Yet Mrs. Teetzel's laws were adamantine </s>
<s> Her rule was as Procrustean as her thinlashed eyes were inquisitive </s>
<s> She daily inspected both her lavishly distributed lambrequins and her gentleman roomers' mail with an occasional discreet excursion into their unlocked trunks </s>
<s> Cooking in a bedroom was as illicit as private laundry work in the secondfloor bathtub </s>
<s> A young Toronto poet who had learned the trick of buttering an envelope and in it neatly shirring an egg over a gas jet was first reminded that he was four weeks behind in his rent and then sadly yet firmly ejected from the topfloor skylight room </s>
<s> So Trotter once back in his own quarters moved about with a caution not untouched with apprehension </s>
<s> Mrs. Teetzel he knew had a tread that was noiseless </s>
<s> She also had the habit of appearing in curlpapers at uncouth moments as unheralded as an apparition from the other world </s>
<s> And Trotter's conscience was not clear </s>
<s> For months past he had kept secreted in his trunk one of those singleholed gas heaters known as a hot plate </s>
<s> This he surreptitiously attached to the gas jet and secretly thereon made coffee and cooked his matutinal hardboiled egg </s>
<s> There was a thrill of excitement about it a tang of outlawry a touch of danger </s>
<s> It took on the romance of a vast hazard </s>
<s> And it also rather suited his purse since that particular newspaper office which he had journeyed to New York both to augment and to uplift showed no undue haste in receiving him </s>
<s> His third and last assault on the Advance office in fact had amounted to an unequivocal ejection </s>
<s> Three short questions from the shirtsleeved autocrat of that benzineodored bedlam had led to Trotter's undoing </s>
<s> He wasn't expected to know much about newspaper work but before he came bothering people he ought at least to know a shadow of something about the city he was living in </s>
<s> And the onetime class orator of the University of Michigan was calmly and pointedly advised to go and cut his eyeteeth on the coral of adversity </s>
<s> He was disgustedly told to go out and make good instead of coming round and bothering busy people </s>
<s> And Trotter went meekly out </s>
<s> But he had not made good </s>
<s> He drifted hungrily about the great new city the city that seemed written in a cipher to which he could find no key </s>
<s> He even guardedly shadowed the resentfuleyed Advance reporters on their morning assignments to get some chance inkling of the magic by which the trick was turned </s>
<s> He wandered about the river front and the ship wharves and the East Side street markets </s>
<s> He nosed inquisitively and audaciously about anarchists' cellars and lodginghouses he found saloons where for a nickel very palatable lamb stew could be purchased he located those swingdoor corners where the most munificent free lunches were on display he dipped into halls where Socialistic fireeaters nightly stilettoed modern civilization he invaded ginmills where strange and barbaric sailors foregathered and talked </s>
<s> From all this he was not learning Journalism </s>
<s> He was however learning New York </s>
<s> But now he had struck lucksudden and unlooked forin the humble creation of rhymeads for a Sixth Avenue furniture store </s>
<s> So having his Bohemian young head somewhat turned by his first check of twenty dollars he had promptly celebrated his return to affluence by as promptly spending a goodly portion of that wealth </s>
<s> He had bidden a cadaverous animal painter named Mershon and two equally hungryeyed Michiganders yclept Albright to his room with the rakish back wall where the feast had been a regal if somewhat subdued one </s>
<s> And now Trotter looked about the room thoughtfully and decided it was time to act </s>
<s> All record of this past orgy would have to be wiped out </s>
<s> The window he knew was impossible for already there had been divers complaints as to the mysterious showers of eggshell which day by day fell into the area below </s>
<s> So Trotter laid several newspapers together </s>
<s> On these outspread newspapers he placed four empty beer bottles a sardine can odds and ends of biscuit and zwieback a wellscraped wooden butter tray andwhat had troubled and haunted him most from the moment of its purchase in a Sixth Avenue delicatessen storethe lugubrious and cleanpicked carcass of a roast turkey </s>
<s> It had been a fine turkey and done to a turn </s>
<s> But all along Trotter had been wondering just how he was going to get rid of those telltale bones </s>
<s> At the merriest moments of the feast the question of the corner in which they could be secreted or the aperture out of which they could be thrust had hung over him like a veritable sword of Damocles </s>
<s> But now he knew there was only one way to solve the problem </s>
<s> And that was to wrap the remains carefully together tie them up and make his escape down through the quiet house into the midnight street </s>
<s> There the everdamnatory parcel could be casually dropped into a nearby ash barrel or tossed into a refuse can and he could aimlessly round the block like a sedentary gentleman enjoying his belated airing </s>
<s> II Trotter crept down through the quiet house with all the trepidation of a sneakthief </s>
<s> His one dread was the apparition of Mrs. Teetzel she would naturally surmise he was making away with the bedroom stoneware or the door knobs or even the lead piping </s>
<s> He felt freer when he had once gained the street </s>
<s> But no peace of mind could be his he knew until he had utterly discarded those carefully wrapped turkey bones </s>
<s> It would be easy enough to toss them into an areaway if the worst came to the worst </s>
<s> He looked up and down the street for a garbage can </s>
<s> But there was none in sight </s>
<s> So he walked toward the avenue corner with his parcel under his arm </s>
<s> There he turned south and at the next corner swung about west again </s>
<s> But the right chance to get rid of his turkey bones had not come </s>
<s> He glanced uneasily about </s>
<s> He suddenly remembered that the police had the habit of holding up belated parcel carriers and inspecting what they carried </s>
<s> So he quickened his steps </s>
<s> But all the while he was covertly on the lookout for his dumping spot </s>
<s> A moment later he saw a patrolman on the street corner ahead of him </s>
<s> He dreaded the thought of passing those scrutinizing eyes </s>
<s> He eventually decided it would be too risky </s>
<s> So he doubled on his own tracks rabbitlike crossing the street and turning north at the next corner </s>
<s> He had had enough of the whole thing </s>
<s> It was getting to be more than a joke </s>
<s> He would shillyshally no longer even though he had to toss the cursed thing up on a house step </s>
<s> He let the parcel slip lower down on his arm with one finger crooked through the string that tied it together </s>
<s> He was about to fling it into the gloom of a brownstone step shadow when the door above opened and a housemaid in cap and apron thrust a plaintively meowing cat from the portico into the street </s>
<s> Trotter quickened his steps tingling abashed shaken with an inordinate and ridiculous sense of guilt </s>
<s> He felt that he wanted to keep out of the light that he ought to skulk in the shadows until he was free of the weight on his arm </s>
<s> He hurried on until he became desperate determined to end the farce at any hazard </s>
<s> So as he passed a building where a house front was being converted into a lowwindowed shop face he dropped the paper package into an abandoned mortar box </s>
<s> He was startled a moment later by a voice calling sharply after him Hi yuh </s>
<s> You've dropped y'ur bundle </s>
<s> Trotter turned guiltily about </s>
<s> It was a night watchman </s>
<s> He stepped slowly out to the mortar box as he spoke and picked up the parcel </s>
<s> There was nothing for Trotter to do but go back and take it </s>
<s> He mumbled somethinghe scarcely remembered whether it was a word of explanation or of thanks </s>
<s> But he felt the eye of the night watchman boring through him like a gimlet and he was glad to edge off and be on his way again </s>
<s> By this time Trotter could feel the sweat of embarrassment on his tingling body </s>
<s> He began to dramatize ridiculous contingencies </s>
<s> He pictured himself as haled into night court as crossexamined by domineering and incredulous magistrates who would send him to the Island as a suspicious person </s>
<s> He began to be haunted by the impression that he was being followed </s>
<s> The parcel became a weight to him a disheartening and dragging weight </s>
<s> He was now sure he was being followed </s>
<s> He squinted back over his shoulders only to catch sight of a nocturnal billsniper placarding vulnerable areas with his lithographed laudations of a vaudeville dancing woman </s>
<s> A child murderer burdened with the body of his victim could not have been more ill at ease more timorous more terrified </s>
<s> A sudden idea came to him as he passed a Chinese laundry in which lights still burned and irons still thumped on an ironing board </s>
<s> It was an audacious one but it pointed toward deliverance </s>
<s> His plan was to enter the laundry and pass over his parcel as though it were his week's washing </s>
<s> He would be gone before they had discovered its contents </s>
<s> He merely needed to be offhand and nonchalant </s>
<s> More than once he had seen dilapidated actors carrying a limited wardrobe to the laundry at equally small hours of the night </s>
<s> And the sloeeyed ironthumpers would never again get sight of him </s>
<s> But it took a moment or two to key himself up to the right pitch </s>
<s> He stepped in beside one of the granite column bases of the First National Trust to give an extra tug to his still lagging courage </s>
<s> He leaned for a moment against the huge steel grillwork that covered the wide bank window behind him looking eastward along the side street to where he could see the oblong of light from the laundry front </s>
<s> A wave of exasperation swept through him at the thought of his own whitelivered irresolution </s>
<s> He was about to step forward to face the end of his dilemma when an unlookedfor movement occurred between him and the illuminated laundry front </s>
<s> It was the movement of a shadowy figure which seemed at first sight to erupt from the earth itself </s>
<s> It was several moments in fact before Trotter realized that the figure had come up from the basement of the building which stood immediately at the rear of the bank the building which also contained the laundry </s>
<s> But this was not the thing that held Trotter's attention </s>
<s> The discovery which was causing his eyes to follow every step of the stranger was the fact that this second man ALSO CARRIED A LARGE PAPER PARCEL UNDER HIS ARM </s>
<s> He turned eastward without looking back </s>
<s> Yet there was something circumspect in his footfall something suspicious in the very casualness of his movements </s>
<s> Trotter leaned out and looked after him nonplused by the coincidence wondering if this second man's mission was the same as his own </s>
<s> He was almost glad to see somebody in the same boat </s>
<s> Then curiosity overcame him </s>
<s> He turned and followed the other man </s>
<s> He walked eastward keeping as well in to the house shadows as he could </s>
<s> He saw the man cross the wider trafficway that ran north and south look quickly up and down the deserted street and then as he gained the shadow of the next house wall veer close in to an iron paling </s>
<s> Then there was a movement which Trotter could not quite make out </s>
<s> It was not until he crossed the street that he saw what the movement meant </s>
<s> It was not until he caught sight of a galvanized ash barrel standing beside the basement step and the stranger ahead of him walking emptyhanded away that Trotter realized the completeness of the coincidence </s>
<s> The other man without so much as stopping for a second had quietly dropped his paperwrapped parcel on the top of the galvanized barrel </s>
<s> At no time did Trotter feel that there was anything momentous in the movement </s>
<s> But it aroused his curiosity </s>
<s> It challenged investigation </s>
<s> It set off his inquisitive young soul into spreading pyrotechnics of imagination </s>
<s> And he realized as he walked up to the barrel that his earlier sense of timidity had disappeared </s>
<s> He quite calmly lifted the parcel from the barrel top </s>
<s> Then he quite calmly dropped the other parcel in its place </s>
<s> He was a little astonished as he started on again at the pregnant weight of this new parcel </s>
<s> But he did not stop to investigate </s>
<s> He did not care to gulp and lose the mystery at one swallow </s>
<s> He scurried off with it chucklingly like a barnyard hen with a corncob to peck at it in solitude </s>
<s> He swung south and then west again to his own street </s>
<s> He went up his own steps through his own door and up to his own topfloor room with the rakish back wall </s>
<s> There he cautiously lighted the gas drew the blinds and locked himself in </s>
<s> Next he dragged a chair over to the bedside sat down on it and carefully untied the parcel string </s>
<s> Then with somewhat accelerated pulse he unwrapped the paperscreened enigma </s>
<s> A little puff of ironic disappointment escaped his pursedup lips </s>
<s> For at one glance he could see that it held no mystery </s>
<s> The only mystery about it all was that he had been theatrical enough to imagine it could prove anything that was not sordid and worthless </s>
<s> For lying on the paper before him was nothing more than a litter of mortar and wall plaster interspersed with stone chips </s>
<s> It was nothing more than the sweepings a bricklayer had left behind him a pile of worthless rubbish a bundle of refuse another white elephant on his hands </s>
<s> Trotter stirred the heap of dust and lime impassively disdainfully </s>
<s> There was nothing more than an occasional brick corner an occasional piece of wall plaster </s>
<s> The only other thing was one larger fragment of stone </s>
<s> Trotter looked at it indolently </s>
<s> It was merely a piece of granitean ounce or two of stone with one highly polished end a bit of refuse which a hurrying mason might have used to rubble a wall crevice </s>
<s> And he had been fool enough to cart it up four flights of stairs </s>
<s> He turned the piece of stone over in his hands </s>
<s> It was of porphyritic granite with distinct crystals of feldspar embedded in a fine grained matrix </s>
<s> Trotter's brow wrinkled in vague thought as he peered down at it </s>
<s> He was trying to think what it reminded him of what possible link it made in a chain of lost association </s>
<s> Then he remembered </s>
<s> It was toward the pillars of the First National Trust Building that his mind was trying to grope </s>
<s> They were of the same stuff highly polished porphyritic granite the pride and wonder of the avenue along which they made a burnished and flashing peristyle </s>
<s> Trotter rubbed his chin meditatively and once more examined the stone </s>
<s> Then he took a sudden deeper breath and leaning hurriedly forward raked through the parcel with his fingers </s>
<s> He found nothing of note </s>
<s> But as he sat there stupidly staring at the fragment of granite his crouching body with his feet tucked in under the chair rungs was startlingly like that familiar figure known as an interrogation mark </s>
<s> III It was nine o'clock the next morning when Trotter carrying a parcel of laundry walked casually past the First National Trust Building and turned the corner </s>
<s> He also made note as he stepped into the openfronted Chinese laundry of this incongruous sidestreet neighbor its squalid meanness cheek by jowl with the lordly magnificence of the manycolumned bank structure </s>
<s> On a narrowfronted ground floor was the crowded little laundry with its redlettered sign its uncurtained windows its shelves of redtagged parcels and its everpresent odor of borax </s>
<s> Below this was a basement a cellar as narrow and dark as a cistern </s>
<s> A flight of perilously inclined steps led to the door of this basement </s>
<s> This door in turn was glassfronted but protected by a heavy wovenwire grating </s>
<s> On it was a sign which read J </s>
<s> HEENEY </s>
<s> PLUMBING WIRING AND ELECTRIC SUPPLIES </s>
<s> It was this basement which so inordinately interested Trotter </s>
<s> He essayed several mild inquiries in handing his frugal parcel of washing over the Chinaman's counter as to the occupant of the cellar below </s>
<s> About J </s>
<s> Heeney however he discovered nothing beyond the fact that he had occupied the cellar for several months </s>
<s> Trotter did not want to arouse unnecessary suspicion by overinterrogating J </s>
<s> Heeney's neighbors </s>
<s> So he went mildly back to his topfloor room and sat down and tried to study things out </s>
<s> As he sat there wrapped in thought his idly wandering gaze rested on the electric bell above the door </s>
<s> He looked at it for several seconds </s>
<s> Then he stood on a chair and twisted away the bell's wiring </s>
<s> Using his pocket knife as a screwdriver he released the bell from the door lintel </s>
<s> Then he cleaned and polished it </s>
<s> This done he removed the clapper wrapped the bell up in a piece of newspaper and made his unhesitating way back to the cellar beneath the Chinese laundry </s>
<s> He was very much awake as he went slowly down the narrow steps </s>
<s> He wanted nothing to escape his notice </s>
<s> He found the wirescreened door at the bottom locked </s>
<s> But he could get a clear enough view of the interior even through the dirty glass </s>
<s> The entire space within was not more than ten feet wide and eight feet deep </s>
<s> It held a litter of plumber's tools a few lengths of gas piping a row of batteries a blowpipe a small handforge a couple of porcelain washbowls a deal table and chair and what seemed to be an electric transformer in a sadly battered case </s>
<s> Across the back of the shop ran a wooden partition plainly shutting off the main part of the cellar </s>
<s> In this partition Trotter's careful scrutiny discovered stood a narrow door </s>
<s> He ached to know what lay behind that door and that partition </s>
<s> But he had to be content with the shallower shop front </s>
<s> So he was not hurried in his inspection of it </s>
<s> It was not until he had fixed the details of the entire place in his mind that he ventured to knock </s>
<s> There was no answer to his knock </s>
<s> Yet it was plain that some one was inside for he could see the key in the lock through the dirty glass </s>
<s> Who that person was he intended to find out </s>
<s> He was rattling the wire fretwork impatiently loudly when the partition door swung open </s>
<s> Through this door stepped a short and extremely broadshouldered man </s>
<s> There was no trace of annoyance on his face </s>
<s> In fact much to Trotter's vague disappointment he was smiling smiling easily and broadly </s>
<s> He wore a workman's jumper stained with oil and iron rust and in his hand he carried a large pair of pipe tongs </s>
<s> But these did not interest Trotter </s>
<s> What caught his eye was the fact that the man's boots were white with lime dust </s>
<s> Hold on sister hold on </s>
<s> said the man with a laugh for Trotter was still rattling the door </s>
<s> The owner stepped across his shop and turned the key in the lock </s>
<s> Hard to hear when I'm in doin' my lathe work he explained as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand </s>
<s> All the while as he swung back the door his eyes were closely studying the eyes of the other man </s>
<s> Trotter noticed the row of matches stuck in the soiled hatband and the cotton bag of Durham that swung from his sweatstained belt </s>
<s> What can I do for you sister </s>
<s> was his companionable greeting </s>
<s> Trotter unwrapped his electric bell </s>
<s> Can you give me a clapper for this </s>
<s> he asked </s>
<s> The other man took the bell in his hand </s>
<s> Trotter could see powdered lime under his nails </s>
<s> I guess I can fix you out said the shop owner </s>
<s> Wait a minute </s>
<s> He turned to the door in the partition and disappeared from sight closing the door after him </s>
<s> Trotter's first decision had been to take the key from the outer door lock </s>
<s> But some sixth sense made him hesitate prompted him to turn and look at the inner door </s>
<s> His stare was rewarded by the discovery of a hole in this door about five feet from the floor </s>
<s> It was a lookout he felt sure he was being watched </s>
<s> So he thrust his hands into his pockets gazed carelessly about the shop and waited </s>
<s> The man reappeared shaking his head </s>
<s> Nothing doing he said </s>
<s> He was not able to fit a clapper to the bell </s>
<s> But I thought you kept electric supplies here objected Trotter </s>
<s> The other man smiled </s>
<s> His good nature was impregnable </s>
<s> Oh I can get it if you've got to have it </s>
<s> Come back about ten tomorrow </s>
<s> All right was Trotter's indifferent answer as he turned languidly away </s>
<s> He went up the steps with equal languor humming as he went </s>
<s> IV Trotter kept guarded watch on J </s>
<s> Heeney's plumbing establishment </s>
<s> He watched it like a hungry cat watching a rat hole </s>
<s> And it was three hours later that he had the satisfaction of seeing the plumber ascend to the street and walk hurriedly westward </s>
<s> Trotter could see that he carried a kit of tools under his arm </s>
<s> But to follow him in open daylight was too great a risk </s>
<s> Instead of that he went down the narrow steps and through the dusty glass examined the doorlock </s>
<s> Fifteen minutes later he went down another flight of basement steps this time to the cellar of a Sixth Avenue locksmith </s>
<s> I've got a closet door locked shut on me he explained </s>
<s> And I want a key to get it open </s>
<s> The locksmith looked him up and dow.n He seemed respectable enough this mildeyed youth with the locked closet </s>
<s> But the locksmith knew the tricks of his trade </s>
<s> Then I'll take a bunch of `blanks' over with me and open her up for you </s>
<s> I'd rather get her open by myself </s>
<s> It will cost you a dollar was the locksmith's ultimatum </s>
<s> It's worth a dollar agreed Trotter </s>
<s> But how'll we do it </s>
<s> I'll dip a skeleton blank in hot wax and lampblack </s>
<s> Then you put the key in the lock and turn it as far as you can </s>
<s> That'll show the ward marks where they bite the wax </s>
<s> Then bring me the key and I'll cut it </s>
<s> Maybe it'll take two cuttings </s>
<s> That'll be two dollars </s>
<s> Trotter paid a quarter deposit and took the key made a circuitous way to the plumber's cellar descended the steps knocked got no answer and quietly inserted the key in the lock turning it as far as it would go </s>
<s> Instead of going back to the locksmith he bought a tencent file and with his own hand cut away the blank according to the ward marks </s>
<s> Once more he made his way to the door of the empty shop and fitted his key </s>
<s> It turned part way round in the lock but did not throw back the bar </s>
<s> He recoated the key flange with the black wax by holding it to a lighted match and letting it cool again </s>
<s> He at once saw where his cutting had been imperfect </s>
<s> A few strokes of his file remedied this </s>
<s> He once more fitted the key to the lock and found that he was free to pass in and out of the door </s>
<s> Yet he deferred forcing an entrance at the moment hungrily as he studied the inner partition door through the irongrated glass </s>
<s> He knew what such a movement meant </s>
<s> He could not count on Heeney's continued absence </s>
<s> Above all at this the beginning of things he wanted to avoid any untimely misstep </s>
<s> So he made his way to the street shuttling cautiously back and forth across the avenue aimless of demeanor diffident of step yet ever and always on the lookout </s>
<s> From half a block away he saw Heeney return to his cellar </s>
<s> From an even remoter stand two hours later he perceived the plumber emerge like a rabbit out of its warren </s>
<s> He also perceived that the rapidly disappearing man carried a large paper parcel under his arm </s>
<s> As before this parcel was carried for three blocks and then adroitly deposited on the top of an ash barrel </s>
<s> Trotter once Heeney had skulked about the next corner quietly crossed the street and sauntered past the parcelcrowned barrel with his open pocketknife in his hand </s>
<s> One sweep of the knife blade slit the paper wrapper and without so much as stopping on his way Trotter was able to catch up a handful of the litter it held </s>
<s> This litter as before was made up of ground mortar and plaster and stone chips </s>
<s> But this time amid the lime and dust he could detect the glitter of minute particles of steel </s>
<s> He tested the larger fragments of these with his knife point </s>
<s> They were very hard harder even than his tempered blade steel diamondlike in their durity </s>
<s> He concluded as he sat on the edge of his bed that night rubbing them between his fingers that they could be nothing but particles of keenlytempered chromium steel </s>
<s> And chromium steel he knew was not used in gas pipes </s>
<s> It was foolish to think of it as a subject for lathe work </s>
<s> It was equally absurd to accept it as an everyday element in any plumber's everyday work </s>
<s> Trotter was not ignorant of the fact that steel of this character was used almost exclusively in the construction of high grade safes and bank vaults </s>
<s> He stood up suddenly and crossed the room to his little bookshelf </s>
<s> From this shelf he took down a muchthumbed World Almanac a paperbound volume which for months past had been serving as his only guide to New York </s>
<s> He turned to the pages headed Banks in Manhattan and Bronx </s>
<s> It took but a minute's search to secure the names of the president and cashier of the First National Trust Company </s>
<s> But when he further read that its capital was three million five hundred thousand and that its total resources amounted to fortyseven million three hundred thousand dollars his breath came in shorter gasps of excitement </s>
<s> He began to realize the colossal wealth which lay guarded behind the great porphyritic granite pillars </s>
<s> He also began to realize some new and as yet undefined responsibility </s>
<s> The mere thought of the magnitude of the movement in which he was being made a deliberate and yet disinterested factor brought him once more to his feet pacing his little den of a room with thoughtful and preoccupied steps </s>
<s> V Early the next morning Trotter was back at the bank corner like a guard at his sentrybox </s>
<s> He kept watch there with that pertinacious alertness peculiar to the idler until he had the satisfaction of witnessing Heeney's early departure from the cellar with a tool kit under his arm </s>
<s> Five minutes later Trotter was descending the stairs that led to the plumber's shop </s>
<s> Once there he took out his key fitted it to the lock opened the door stepped quietly inside and locked the outer door after him </s>
<s> Before venturing to open the inner door he pressed an ear flat against the wooden partition and stood there listening </s>
<s> The silence was unbroken </s>
<s> He stepped to the side of the shop and caught up a plumber's thickbodied tallow candle </s>
<s> Then he softly opened the second door stepped inside and as softly closed the door after him </s>
<s> He found himself in perfect darkness </s>
<s> But he stood there waiting before venturing to move forward before daring to strike a light </s>
<s> He knew as he peered about the blackness that engulfed him that he was now facing more than an indeterminate responsibility </s>
<s> He was confronting actual and immediate danger </s>
<s> Even as he stood there sniffing at the air so heavy with its smell of damp lime and its undecipherable underground gases a sudden fuller consciousness of undefined and yet colossal peril sent a telegraphing tingle of nerves up and down his body </s>
<s> The only thing that broke the silence was the faint sound of footsteps on the laundry floor above him together with the steady thump of irons on the ironing table </s>
<s> There was something fortifying something consoling in those neighborly and sedentary little noises </s>
<s> Trotter struck a match and lighted his candle </s>
<s> He waited without moving for the flame to grow </s>
<s> Then he thrust the candle up before him </s>
<s> As he did so his hand came in contact with the rough surface of what at first he took to be a stone wall </s>
<s> But as he looked closer he saw that it was not masonry </s>
<s> It was nothing more nor less than a carefully piled mass of stone and brick </s>
<s> Each fragment had been carefully placed on top of its fellow each interstice had been carefully filled with rubble </s>
<s> The pile extended from floor to ceiling </s>
<s> It filled the entire cellar </s>
<s> It left only space enough for a man to pass inward from the opened door </s>
<s> It was nothing more than the dump of a mine the rock and brick from a tunnel not flung loosely about but scrupulously stowed away </s>
<s> Holding the candle in front of him Trotter bent low and groped his way in through the narrow passage </s>
<s> Everything was as orderly and hidden as the approach to a wild animal's lair </s>
<s> Everything was eloquent of a keen secretiveness </s>
<s> No betraying litter met his eye </s>
<s> Each move had been calmly and cautiously made </s>
<s> Each step of a complicated campaign had been quietly engineered </s>
<s> Trotter could even decipher a series of electric wires festooned from the little tunnel's top </s>
<s> He could see where the passage had gone around obstacles where it had curled about a dishearteningly heavy buttress base where it had dipped lower to underrun a cement vault bed where it had sheered off from the tinfoiled surface of a closedcurcuit protective system and where it had dipped and twisted about to advance squarely into a second blind wall at right angles to the first </s>
<s> A portion of this wall had been torn away </s>
<s> With equal care an inner coating of cement had been chiseled off exposing to view an unbroken dark surface </s>
<s> As Trotter held the candle closer he could see this dark surface marked off with chalk lines sometimes with crosses sometimes with figures he could not decipher </s>
<s> On it too he could see a solitary depression as round and bright as a silver coin as though a diamond drill had been testing the barrier </s>
<s> He knew even before he touched the chill surface with his hand that it was a wall of solid steel that it was the steel of the bank vault itself the one deephidden and masonryembedded area which stood without its evervigilant closedcircuit sentry </s>
<s> And he knew that Heeney had grubbed and eaten and burrowed his way like a woodchuck to the very heart of the First National Trust's wealth </s>
<s> It was only then that the stupendousness of the whole thing came home to Trotter </s>
<s> It was only then that he realized the almost superhuman cunning and pertinacity in this guilelesseyed cellar plotter called Heeney </s>
<s> He could see the hours of patient labor it had involved the days and days of molelike tunneling the weeks and weeks of gnomelike burrowing and carrying and twisting and loosening and piling the months of antlike industry which one blow of the Law's heel would make as nothing </s>
<s> It rather bewildered Trotter </s>
<s> It filled him with an everincreasing passion to get away from the place to escape while he still had a chance </s>
<s> It turned the gaseous underground tunnel into a stifling pit making his breath come in short and wheezing gasps </s>
<s> It brought a tinybeaded sweat out on his chilled body </s>
<s> Then he stopped breathing altogether </s>
<s> He wheeled about and suddenly brought his thumb and forefinger together on the candle flame pinching it out as one might pinch the life out of a moth </s>
<s> For on his straining ears fell the sound of a door slammed shut </s>
<s> There was no mistake no illusion about it </s>
<s> Some one had entered the shop </s>
<s> Then came the sound of a second door </s>
<s> This time it was being opened </s>
<s> And it was the door leading into the tunnel </s>
<s> Trotter could see the momentary efflorescence of pale light at the bend in the passage before him </s>
<s> And he realized that he was unarmed </s>
<s> He had not even a crowbar not even a chisel or wrench with which to defend himself </s>
<s> He knew he stood there trapped and helpless </s>
<s> He shrank back instinctively without being conscious of the movement </s>
<s> He heard the sound of steps shuffling and short </s>
<s> Then came an audible grunt a grunt of relief </s>
<s> This was followed by the thump of a heavy weight dropped to the brick floor </s>
<s> Then came the sound of steps again still shuffling and short </s>
<s> Trotter leaned forward listening waiting with every nerve strained </s>
<s> He concentrated every sense on the blur of light along the tunnel wall before him </s>
<s> As he peered forward scarcely daring to breathe he was conscious of the fact that the light had suddenly withered </s>
<s> It vanished from the refracting tunnel sides as though wiped away by an obliterating black sponge </s>
<s> Even before the truth of the thing had come home to him he heard the sound of a quietly closed door </s>
<s> Heeney had gone </s>
<s> He had merely crept into his tunnel mouth dropped some tools and then quietly crept out again </s>
<s> It was not until he heard the slam of the outer door a moment or two later that Trotter felt sure of his deliverance </s>
<s> It was not until he knew his enemy was up the steps that he let his aching lungs gulp in the fetid tunnel air </s>
<s> Then he crept forward cautiously obsessed by one impulse the impulse of escape the passion to reach the open to find air and light and space once more about him </s>
<s> He did nothing more than feel hurriedly over the bundle that lay in his path </s>
<s> It seemed an instrument of steel tied up in a cloth </s>
<s> He could feel strand after strand of wires ductile and clothcovered wires </s>
<s> He could also decipher a disk through which ran a piece of metal like a blade through a sword guard </s>
<s> He felt sure it was an electrode of some sort a tool to convert stolen electricity into a weapon of offense and assault </s>
<s> But he neither waited to strike a light nor stooped to puzzle over the bundle </s>
<s> He paused for a minute to listen at the closed partition door </s>
<s> The only sound that came to his ears was the shuffle of feet and the thump from the ironing board above him </s>
<s> Yet when he opened this partition door he did so noiselessly cautiously slowly inch by inch </s>
<s> Still screened in shadow he studied the shop the steps the wireblurred window the street above him </s>
<s> Then he took a deep breath crossed to the shop door unlocked it stepped outside relocked it after him and pocketing the key climbed the steps to the sidewalk </s>
<s> His face as he came out to the light was almost colorless </s>
<s> His eyes were wide and staring with wonder </s>
<s> He kept telling himself that he must walk slowly that he must in no way betray himself that he must appear indifferent and offhand and inconspicuous to every one he chanced to pass </s>
<s> He felt the necessity of guarding himself for he was now a person of importance </s>
<s> He was an emissary of destiny an agent entrusted with a vast issue </s>
<s> The streets through which he passed no longer frowned down at him from their inhospitable skylines </s>
<s> He was no longer an unattached and meaningless unit in the life that throbbed and roared all about him </s>
<s> He meant something to it </s>
<s> He was part of it </s>
<s> He was its guardian </s>
<s> And it would acknowledge him in the end or he would know the reason why </s>
<s> VI Trotter sat peering mildly about him as that Gargantuan organism known as a newspaper office labored and shrieked in the birth of an afternoon edition </s>
<s> Subterranean Hoe presses roared and hummed telegraph keys clicked and cluttered typewriters tapped and clattered like a dozen highholders on a hollow elm telephone bells shrilled shouting pressmen came and went unkempt copy boys trailed back and forth with their festoons of limp galley proof and Hubbart with closeset eyes and a forehead like a bisected ostrich egg sat at the City Desk calmly presiding over an otherwise frenzied accouchement </s>
<s> It interested Trotter </s>
<s> It interested him very much </s>
<s> But it no longer filled him with mingled fear and revolt </s>
<s> He was indeed no longer envious just as he was no longer nervous </s>
<s> He was as calm as a Nihilist with a bomb in his pocket </s>
<s> Looking up he saw that the office boy was holding the rail gate open for him to enter </s>
<s> But he was conscious of no spirit of elation as he stepped through the gate and passed on into that glassfronted cage where Pyott the managing editor sat like a switchman in his manylevered tower </s>
<s> Trotter saw seated at a desk before him a thinfeatured thinhaired man of forty with the crumpledup eyecorners peculiar to the face that masks a circuitous and secretive mind </s>
<s> It was a face full of that weary concern that alert indifferency which is companion to the spirit of repeated compromise </s>
<s> It was far from an open face it seemed to betray only two things tiredness and satiric intelligence </s>
<s> The man at the desk did not even look up </s>
<s> He merely flung a barbed Well </s>
<s> over his shoulder </s>
<s> It reminded Trotter of the preoccupied tail swish of a horse worried by a blackfly </s>
<s> The side flick of one casual monosyllable was plainly all he was worth </s>
<s> Trotter calmly sat down </s>
<s> I've been waiting for six months for a job on this paper he began quite seriously quite deliberately </s>
<s> The man at the desk went on writing </s>
<s> The pen did not even stop </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> This second monosyllable was neither an answer nor a question </s>
<s> It was merely an intimation that nothing of arresting moment had as yet been uttered </s>
<s> So I've come straight to you </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> This third exclamation was plainly a challenge to come to the issue in hand </s>
<s> I've been thrown down three Excuse me the man at the desk had his hand on a desk 'phone standard but you'd better see our city editor </s>
<s> Trotter laughed a little </s>
<s> I've seen the city editor four times </s>
<s> It's no use </s>
<s> He only throws me out </s>
<s> For the first time Pyott the managing editor looked up </s>
<s> Then he swung about in his swivel chair and stared at the youth the somewhat narrowchested and calmeyed youth who had the effrontery to sit down without being asked </s>
<s> The calmeyed youth seemed in no way daunted by the ordeal </s>
<s> What do you want </s>
<s> was Pyott's quick and curt demand </s>
<s> I want a job </s>
<s> The editor's face darkened </s>
<s> Trotter could see that he had angered him </s>
<s> He could see a lean hand shoot out and a lean finger push down on the button that sounded a buzzer in the outer office </s>
<s> There's no use doing that till you've heard what I've got to say announced Trotter </s>
<s> Why not </s>
<s> snapped the man with a finger still on the button </s>
<s> Because your man Hubbart out there told me not to stick my nose in here till I'd made goodtill I'd got a big story </s>
<s> And now I've got it </s>
<s> And I'm going to give you the biggest scoop you've printed in five years </s>
<s> That's interesting </s>
<s> I'd never have had the nerve to face you if it wasn't </s>
<s> A boy appeared through the door </s>
<s> The editor swung back to his desk </s>
<s> Show this gentleman the way downstairs he said without anger without resentment without interest </s>
<s> Trotter stood up and stared at him </s>
<s> You mean you're not going to take this beat when I've got it right here to hand out to you </s>
<s> he cried in his startled and highpitched voice </s>
<s> You're not going to give me my chance </s>
<s> What chance </s>
<s> What beat are you talking about </s>
<s> A beat that involves the theft of millions of dollars </s>
<s> And what's going to happen to your millions of dollars </s>
<s> Trotter sat down in the chair again </s>
<s> It's going to be stolen every cent of it </s>
<s> The man at the desk smiled </s>
<s> It was a very faint and mirthless smile </s>
<s> You said that before I think </s>
<s> But who's taking it </s>
<s> One of the most accomplished crooks in all America </s>
<s> And from where </s>
<s> was the next indulgent interrogation </s>
<s> From one of the richest banks in this city </s>
<s> Trotter's calm and deliberate tones were beginning to nettle the other man a little </s>
<s> Then it hasn't actually been done </s>
<s> No </s>
<s> Yet you know it IS to be done </s>
<s> Yes </s>
<s> Pyott was smiling by this time quite broadly </s>
<s> Would you kindly tell me just how you know all this </s>
<s> Just what first opened up the road to your somewhat startling knowledge </s>
<s> Some turkey bones </s>
<s> Ah I see </s>
<s> Some turkey bones </s>
<s> He nodded approvingly indulgently </s>
<s> And what were you doing with these particular turkey bones </s>
<s> Putting them in a garbage can </s>
<s> Ah </s>
<s> You were putting some turkey bones in a garbage can </s>
<s> And as you were about to do this </s>
<s> I caught sight of another man also trying to get rid of a parcel </s>
<s> Turkey bones of course </s>
<s> A butterball's bosom was no more impervious to slough water than the rapteyed youth to the older man's irony </s>
<s> When I opened his parcel I found it held mortar and stone and some steel cuttings </s>
<s> And this led you to infer </s>
<s> This led me to follow him </s>
<s> He had a basement I found directly in the rear of a bank building </s>
<s> What bank building </s>
<s> That's my story </s>
<s> And I trust the locality agreed with him </s>
<s> Extremely well was Trotter's mildtoned reply </s>
<s> In fact it was essential for him to be side by side with that particular bank building where he could quietly tunnel his way through its back wall and burrow under its floors and eat a passage right through to its vaults </s>
<s> The man at the desk sighed and looked at the obsessed youth with a smile too impersonal to be called pitying </s>
<s> Vaults </s>
<s> That's a matter for the police </s>
<s> This is a newspaper office </s>
<s> But can't you see the story in it </s>
<s> Can't you see what it means when you're the only people who're in on it </s>
<s> You'll have to show me your Eskimo </s>
<s> remarked the unperturbed editor </s>
<s> That's what I'm here for </s>
<s> cried the exasperated youth </s>
<s> Still again the man at the desk eyed his visitor for a minute of silence </s>
<s> Then he reached for his telephone </s>
<s> I want Kendrick and Gilman for some city work </s>
<s> Send 'em in to me </s>
<s> Yes right away please </s>
<s> Pyott swung about to his visitor once more </s>
<s> I'm giving you our two best men </s>
<s> They'll do what you tell them to do </s>
<s> But that'll make it THEIR story </s>
<s> objected Trotter </s>
<s> I want to land this myself </s>
<s> I want it to be mine </s>
<s> Then what am I to do </s>
<s> Trotter scarcely knew </s>
<s> But he had not forgotten the thing he had waited and hungered for this many a month </s>
<s> Put me on your staff first so I can be acting for somebody </s>
<s> Still again the editor smiled </s>
<s> You're set on being one of us aren't you </s>
<s> I've got to have something behind me before I can tackle a job like this </s>
<s> All right was the wearily indulgent answer call yourself one of us </s>
<s> Now what else do you want </s>
<s> I guess you'd better give me one of your workmen for a lookout suggested the narrowchested youth </s>
<s> Why a workman </s>
<s> Why not Kendrick or Gilman </s>
<s> All I want is a husky man to see I'm not interfered with from outside replied the new and jealous god of the press world </s>
<s> Then I'll land the story myself </s>
<s> The managing editor's finger end was once more on the buzzer </s>
<s> I'll give you Tiernan of the job room </s>
<s> He's Irish and weighs two hundred </s>
<s> Is there anything else </s>
<s> I s'pose I'll need a gun ruminated the mildeyed youth </s>
<s> But I'm willing to buy that with my own money </s>
<s> It was not the purchase of the gun that was troubling him </s>
<s> It was the thought that he had never in all his life so much as discharged a revolver </s>
<s> He would not even know how to load it </s>
<s> But then Tiernan would doubtless be able to show him </s>
<s> A telephone bell was shrilling at the editor's elbow </s>
<s> Is that all </s>
<s> demanded the impatient man of affairs as he turned to the 'phone </s>
<s> He called a cryptic sentence or two into the transmitter and slapped the receiver back on its hook </s>
<s> Yes I guess that's all answered the wideeyed boy with his hat in his hand </s>
<s> Then go and make good said the man at the desk as Tiernan swung in through the office door </s>
<s> Go and get your story </s>
<s> VII In a newspaper office where one impression so quickly and inevitably obliterates another sensation is startling only in the fact of its ephemerality </s>
<s> For two busy hours wave after wave of the world's turbulence had beaten on the shoreline of the Advance staff's attention </s>
<s> Every one knew from Pyott down that the day was a big one </s>
<s> And since it is seldom the everarriving guests of sensation which disturb a newspaper office but rather the secondary thought of bestowing them in their right chamber and bed and fitting them with their right heading nightcaps the ordeal of the Advance's day had reached its second and most exacting crisis </s>
<s> So when Pyott the managing editor was called up on the wire by Obed Tyrer the President of the First National Trust the call from that quarter carried with it no responsive curiosity </s>
<s> Can you come up here right away </s>
<s> demanded the banker in a voice of that coerced tranquillity into which the trained mind translates itself when face to face with undue excitement </s>
<s> No I can't </s>
<s> Why can't you </s>
<s> Well among other things I've got the trifling matter of a paper to put to press </s>
<s> What's wrong </s>
<s> You know what's wrong </s>
<s> Do I </s>
<s> And you and your men let this go through two whole weeks of it for the sake of your little yellowjournal scarehead </s>
<s> Look here Tyrer I'm a busy man </s>
<s> Tell me what you're talking about or ring off </s>
<s> I'm talking about the lunacy of a onecent journalist who's willing to risk even his own funds for the sake of an afternoon beat </s>
<s> I tell you Pyott the whole story's got to be stopped </s>
<s> What story </s>
<s> The Advance story </s>
<s> I've got your man Trotter here now </s>
<s> He Ah Trotter </s>
<s> exclaimed Pyott </s>
<s> He was at last beginning to see light </s>
<s> I've got him and your jobroom man named Tiernan up here but I can't do anything with Trotter </s>
<s> He's mad mad as a March hare </s>
<s> Says he's got to get his story down to you for today's issue </s>
<s> So you've got Trotter there </s>
<s> What else have you got </s>
<s> Will you hold things up till I run down and talk it over </s>
<s> Will you promise me that much </s>
<s> Pyott laughed </s>
<s> Then young Trotter got his story after all </s>
<s> Got his story </s>
<s> Of course he got it </s>
<s> And in another four hours that safecracker would have drilled right into our vitals </s>
<s> I tell you we can't imperil our institution this way </s>
<s> We can't let that stuff get out </s>
<s> We can't do it </s>
<s> Nobody's going to break your nice new bank Obed </s>
<s> You run down here in a taxi and we'll try to straighten things out </s>
<s> But what'll I do with Trotter </s>
<s> How're we ever going to hold him in </s>
<s> Where's your safecracker man </s>
<s> We've got him right here </s>
<s> Burns is sending over an A </s>
<s> B </s>
<s> P </s>
<s> A </s>
<s> man to take care of him </s>
<s> D'you mean he's hurt </s>
<s> No no </s>
<s> We've identified him as Missouri Horton of the Scott Ganghe got a Sing Sing life sentence for yegg work in Yonkers </s>
<s> But Burns tells me he had enough money buried away to buy Tammany influence and get paroled </s>
<s> Can't you see what that means </s>
<s> Which way </s>
<s> To your office or to mine </s>
<s> To us </s>
<s> They've got him now for life </s>
<s> They can get him back to Sing Sing and keep the whole cursed thing under cover </s>
<s> There was a moment's silence before the cogitating Pyott spoke again </s>
<s> And you say you've got Trotter right there with you </s>
<s> Yes but he's acting like a madman in the VicePresident's private room </s>
<s> Again there was a moment's silence </s>
<s> Then give him ink and papergive him lots of it </s>
<s> Tell him I've said for him to write the story THERE </s>
<s> Tell him to sling himself that I want every detail every fact and ten solid columns of it </s>
<s> What are you driving at </s>
<s> I'm driving at this keep him busy man </s>
<s> Don't you see </s>
<s> Keep him writing there until the thing's worked out of his system </s>
<s> Then I'll tame him down later </s>
<s> Meanwhile you'd better clean house up there so you can officially contradict the whole story if the yellows happen to get after you </s>
<s> But nothing can get out I tell you unless you PUT it out </s>
<s> Then what are you worrying about </s>
<s> Young Trotter says he's got to send his stuff in </s>
<s> He's not satisfied with the mere idea of writing it </s>
<s> Then give him one of your men two of your men for carriers </s>
<s> Tell him to keep sending his copy down in relays as he writes it </s>
<s> But don't let him get away </s>
<s> Oh I'll hold him here if I have to nail him to the floor </s>
<s> I tell you a thing like this would shake public confidence </s>
<s> It'd be worse than a fireproof hotel going up in flames </s>
<s> It would mean an alarming and immediate depreciation in our credit a deplorable Of course it would </s>
<s> Come down as soon as you can and tell me all that </s>
<s> I'll have more time then </s>
<s> Pyott hung up the receiver </s>
<s> He poised for one brief and immobile moment deep in thought before he swung about to the three exigent figures making signs for his attention </s>
<s> Then the thinfeatured manywrinkled wearyeyed face relaxed in an almost honest and unequivocal smile </s>
<s> VIII Trotter shut in the VicePresident's private office paid little attention to his surroundings </s>
<s> He did not even know that the desk on which he wrote was of mahogany </s>
<s> He did not notice the imported Daghestan under his feet </s>
<s> He was unconscious of the orchids in the low deskvase of French silver </s>
<s> He was oblivious of the onyx and marble elegance that surrounded him </s>
<s> All he knew was that he had paper and ink in plenty and the Greatest Story of the Age to write </s>
<s> All he knew was that time was precious that two trusted messengers stood before him to deliver his copy that presses in the lower part of the city waited like hungry animals to gulp down his story and that before nightfall a million eyes would widen and half a million hearts would beat a little faster at the words that he was about to write </s>
<s> He pushed back the silver and cutglass desk ornaments the heavy goldframed portrait of a young girl standing beside an opulentbosomed woman in an opera cloak the foolish vase of orchids </s>
<s> He made space for himself and his work </s>
<s> And then he wrote </s>
<s> He wrote with all the rhapsodic passion of a god creating a new world </s>
<s> He began with a preamble that would have broken a copyreader's heart </s>
<s> He followed it up with atmospheric discursiveness that would have worn away an editor's blue pencil </s>
<s> He told how Steam and Steel were supposed to have crushed the Spirit of Romance out of the age </s>
<s> He pointed out how the modern city of stone and concrete seemed no longer to house that wayward and retrospective spirit in which the heart of the poet has forever reveled </s>
<s> Then he sought to demonstrate how true Romance can never die how Wonder is all about even the Wall Street clerk and the fiveo'clock commuter </s>
<s> He put forward the claim that modern New York was as potentially picturesque as alluringly labyrinthine as olden Bagdad itself </s>
<s> He argued that the Thousand and One Tales were nightly recurring in our very midst only we had neither the eyes nor the leisure to observe them </s>
<s> He told of the strange underworlds hidden from the casual eye of subterranean rivers of life which Respectability never sees </s>
<s> He showed how it was only the face of life that had changed </s>
<s> He intimated that Stevenson had unearthed romance enough in an uptodate London that Hugo and Balzac had found it in Paris and he eloquently proclaimed that even today it was to be stumbled across in our city of homes on the Hudson </s>
<s> It was a very rhythmical piece of fine writing and he had his coat off and was working in his shirt sleeves before he had advanced six pages into it </s>
<s> Then he veered about to the story itself </s>
<s> He enlarged on the amount of wealth harbored by a national bank </s>
<s> He explained how this vast wealth was hoarded and protected the massive walls the steel vaults the steam flood pipes the everwatching attendants the tangle of articulate wires that a touch would make garrulous the time locks the floors of cement and railway iron the contact mats which reported the slightest footfall of the trespasser </s>
<s> Then he told how an idea had come to the mind of an idle yegg named Missouri Horton </s>
<s> He told how this wary and cunning and romanticspirited outlaw had planned his attack how he had hired the cellar next to the granitewalled citadel of opulence how he had learned the location of the vaults how he had figured out the thickness of the masonry how he had slowly and quietly prepared for his lonely and Promethean attack </s>
<s> Trotter's sallow young face grew chalkier as he wrote though he was unconscious of either effort or weariness </s>
<s> They brought him luncheon in due time on a napkincovered tray </s>
<s> He lifted the napkin peevishly took a disdainful look at the food gulped down a cup of black coffee and pushed the mess away from him </s>
<s> He had serious work in hand </s>
<s> He wrote on unconscious of time </s>
<s> His mind seemed to sway hypnotically with the reverberations of his own rhetoric </s>
<s> He tossed in a classical allusion or two here and there he left an Old Testament phrase to coruscate along the fringe of his text he even called back one of his copy carriers to revise an unelaborated figure of speech </s>
<s> Then he told how the tunnel was begun how brick by brick and stone by stone a passage was grubbed through every obstacle </s>
<s> He expatiated on the infinite patience of such a man as Horton how Monte Cristo paled beside him how vast difficulties had to be overcome how every stone had to be stowed carefully away in the back of the cellar how in time the mortar and cement had to be ground to a powder and carried secretly away </s>
<s> He told how the tunnel was pushed forward foot by foot how the bank was attacked in its one and only vital spot precisely as a porcupine curled defensively up in the snow is seized by the fishermarten not through open attack but by artfully tunneling up under the quillless belly </s>
<s> Then he retailed how the vast business of this great banking institution went tranquilly and ponderously on how millions were handled and changed and stowed away while all the time the unknown enemy was inch by inch crawling nearer </s>
<s> When a note came up from the Advance office signed by the managing editorthe managing editor who had never been known to praise one of his men in all his twelveyear regimeTrotter took it as a matter of course </s>
<s> Your story is great this note had read </s>
<s> Keep it up </s>
<s> Trotter merely gave the scrawl a second hurried glance </s>
<s> It did not excite him it did not intoxicate </s>
<s> He was already drunk with the wine of creation as delirious as a whirling dervish </s>
<s> And he knew he still had work to do </s>
<s> A whitewhiskered gentleman wearing a pearlbuttoned white waistcoat stepped quietly up to the office door and peered guardedly in over his glasses </s>
<s> Then he tiptoed away unseen with a condoning smile on his astute and thinnosed old face </s>
<s> Trotter had no thought or memory of his surroundings </s>
<s> It was his Story the Story of his life </s>
<s> He sat there entangled and locked together with it unconscious of what it was doing to him oblivious of how like a bloodsucking vampire it was draining the vigor of his youth from him </s>
<s> He was now in the very vortex of his story </s>
<s> He told how he had posted Tiernan at the head of the steps leading down into the plumber's shop </s>
<s> He cunningly enlarged on the huge Irishman's bewilderment his incredulity his blasphemously reiterated demand to know what it was all about </s>
<s> He told how he himself had silently entered the shop how he had crept through to the second door how he had waited for a moment to take out his revolver </s>
<s> He described the hot and reeking air of the tunnel as he crept into its mouth </s>
<s> He pictured the sudden glare of light at the shaft end where Horton stood burning away an outer vault wall with an electrode </s>
<s> He told how the heat and the fumes of that little underground hell bewildered him how he stood gaping at the scene watching the whitehot tongue of fire hissing and licking at its last barrier of steel </s>
<s> He did not neglect to paint how the hardened metal under the electrolyzing current eroding its surface became as chalk decomposing into a charry mass which one blow of a hammer might penetrate </s>
<s> He told how he crept up on the man step by step with his revolver in his hand </s>
<s> He told how he could see the safebreaker's face shining with sweat how he could smell scorching clothing how his eyes began to ache with the lightglare until he threw up a forearm to protect them </s>
<s> He explained how it had been his intention to creep up on the criminal and seize him bodily and how he was defeated in this by a sudden and unlookedfor movement on the part of his unsuspecting enemy </s>
<s> Horton had quickly swung abouthe was in fact groping along the passage floor for a twoquart tin pail partly filled with tap water </s>
<s> The glare had blinded him for the time being and he was in reality feeling for a drink </s>
<s> But the Advance reporter had thought the movement meant that his presence was discovered </s>
<s> And the two men had come together </s>
<s> Trotter told of the fight there hand to hand in the choking tunnel with its tangle of deadly currents </s>
<s> He recounted how the other man's strength had been greater than his own how he felt his breath going how he saw himself being forced closer and closer back on the glaring electrode </s>
<s> He confessed that he had been excited and foolish enough to lose the revolver </s>
<s> He mentioned his indignation when he saw that the other man was actually trying to use his teeth </s>
<s> He described how for the first time it came home to him that he would be killed there that Tiernan could not possibly hear his cries that his heart could not possibly continue to beat without fresh air </s>
<s> Then he had grown desperate </s>
<s> He had apparently gone mad </s>
<s> He had started to use his own teeth </s>
<s> He had set his jaw on the yeggman's hand as it groped for his throat </s>
<s> He had caught the index finger of the other blackened hand and levered it savagely backward backward until the bone broke and it hung limp on the tortured tendon </s>
<s> He had sent the relaxed head skidding against the tunnel wall once twice three times until the sweatstained arms fell away and left him free </s>
<s> He had sat there for many minutes stupidly staring at the unconscious man </s>
<s> Then he had found the revolver at his feet and being too weak to get up he had still sat there contentedly firing a volley of bullets against the steel vault wall until the bank officials were alarmed and an armed guard was sent scurrying about to investigate </s>
<s> And with the timely arrival of Tiernan and that armed guard came an end to the most audacious and staggering criminal coup of the century </s>
<s> It was all very beautiful the very finest of fine writing </s>
<s> Trotter poured his ardent and exultant young soul into it </s>
<s> And when his last page had been written and sent away he sat back in the widearmed moroccoupholstered bankroom chair white with weariness the fires of creation burnt out to the last ember </s>
<s> But one thing sustained and consoled him </s>
<s> He knew as he whisked down to the Advance office in the VicePresident's French touring car that his work was done </s>
<s> He also knew that it was well done </s>
<s> It did not even startle him when Pyott himself held out a coldfingered hand </s>
<s> Good business </s>
<s> was his chief's sardonic commendation </s>
<s> Then I've made good </s>
<s> asked the weary youth without enthusiasm </s>
<s> You've made your TENSTRIKE </s>
<s> was the answer </s>
<s> You're on the city staff at twenty dollars a week </s>
<s> When do I have to go over my proofs </s>
<s> asked the tiredeyed and innocent youth </s>
<s> What proofs </s>
<s> My story proofs </s>
<s> Pyott forced his eyes to meet those of the palefaced boy looking up at him </s>
<s> The managing editor did so without an outward flinch </s>
<s> He was more or less used to such things </s>
<s> You've made good my boy </s>
<s> He casually turned away before he spoke the next sentence </s>
<s> BUT WE'VE HAD TO KILL THAT STORY OF YOURS </s>
<s> Trotter did not move </s>
<s> He did not even gulp </s>
<s> He merely closed his tired eyes and at the same time let his lower lip fall a trifle away from the upper as his breath came brokenly between them </s>
<s> Then he sat down </s>
<s> For they had done more than kill his story </s>
<s> They had killed the spirit of Youth in him </s>
<s> There would be other battles he knew and perhaps other victoriesbut never again that fine careless rapture of Youth </s>
<s> For they had killed his firstborn </s>

<s> 6 AN OPEN MIND WILLIAM JAMES p 800801 By WALTER LIPPMANN Within a week of the death of Professor William James of Harvard University the newspapers had it that Mr. M. S </s>
<s> Ayer of Boston had received a message from his spirit </s>
<s> This news item provoked the ridicule of the people who don't believe in ghosts but the joke was on Mr. Ayer of Boston </s>
<s> When however it was reported that Professor James himself had agreed to communicate with this world if he could and in order to test the reports had left a sealed message to be opened at a certain definite time after his death the incredulous gasped at the professor's amazing credulity </s>
<s> William James wasn't credulous </s>
<s> He was simply openminded </s>
<s> Maybe the soul of man is immortal </s>
<s> The professors couldn't prove it wasn't so James was willing to open his mind to evidence </s>
<s> He was willing to hunt for evidence and to be convinced by it </s>
<s> And in that he was simply keeping America's promise he was actually doing what we as a nation proclaimed that we would do </s>
<s> He was tolerant he was willing to listen to what seems preposterous and to consider what might though queer be true </s>
<s> And he showed that this democratic attitude of mind is every bit as fruitful as the aristocratic determination to ignore new and strangelooking ideas </s>
<s> James was a democrat </s>
<s> He gave all men and all creeds any idea any theory any superstition a respectful hearing </s>
<s> His interest in spiritualism is merely one illustration in a thousand </s>
<s> The hard scientists knew it was a hoax because they couldn't explain it and the sentimentalists knew it was the truth because they wished it to be but James wanted to know the facts </s>
<s> So he went to Mrs. Piper and heard her out </s>
<s> Nay he listened to Palladino and to Munsterberg </s>
<s> They pretended to know and maybe they did </s>
<s> And last year when Frank Harris published his book on Shakespeare to show that the unknown life and character of the poet could be drawn from his works the other professors laughed the theory out of court </s>
<s> James went to Shakespeare and read the plays all over again to test the Harris theory </s>
<s> Maybe the poet could be known by his works </s>
<s> The fact that the theory was revolutionary did not alter the possibility that it might be true </s>
<s> So with religion </s>
<s> A scientist living in an age when science is dogmatically irreligious he turned from its cocksure reasoning to ask for the facts </s>
<s> He went to the lives of the saints </s>
<s> Not to Herbert Spencer you see </s>
<s> When he wanted to study the religious experience he went to the people who had had it to Santa Theresa and Mrs. Eddy </s>
<s> They might know something the professors didn't know </s>
<s> And again at the age of sixtyfive with the whole of New England's individualism behind him he asked about socialism </s>
<s> When he met H </s>
<s> G </s>
<s> Wells he listened to the socialist and as it happens was converted </s>
<s> So he said so </s>
<s> James was no more afraid of a new political theory than he was of ghosts and he was no more afraid of proclaiming a new theory or an old one than he was of being a ghost </s>
<s> I think he would have listened with an open mind to the devil's account of heaven and I'm sure he would have heard him out on hell </s>
<s> James knew that he didn't know </s>
<s> He never acted upon the notion that the truth was his store of wisdom </s>
<s> Perhaps that is why he kept on rummaging about in other people's stores and commending their goods </s>
<s> He seemed to take a delight in writing introductions and appreciations of new books and in going out of his way to listen to a young doctor of philosophy or an undergraduate discussion of pragmatism or the poetry of an obscure mystic </s>
<s> And optimist that he was by virtue of his unceasing freshness of interest there is nothing more openminded in our literature than his chivalrous respect for the pessimism of Francis Thompson </s>
<s> Speak not of comfort where no comfort is Speak not at all can words make foul things fair </s>
<s> Our life's a cheat our death a black abyss Hush and be mute envisaging despair </s>
<s> He felt with all sorts of men </s>
<s> He understood their demand for immediate answers to the great speculative questions of life </s>
<s> God freedom immortality nature as moral or nonmoralthese were for him not matters of idle scientific wonder but of urgent need The scientific demand that men should wait till doomsday or till such time as our senses and intellect working together may have raked in evidence enough for answers to these questions is says James the queerest idol ever manufactured in the philosophic cave </s>
<s> We cannot wait for a final solution </s>
<s> Our daily life is full of choices that we cannot dodge and some guide we simply must have </s>
<s> There can be no loitering at the crossroads </s>
<s> We are busy </s>
<s> We must choose whether we will it or not and where all is doubt who shall refuse us the right to believe what seems most adapted to our needs </s>
<s> Not know you understand but believe </s>
<s> That is the famous position taken in The Will to Believe </s>
<s> As James has once pointed out its real title should have been The Right to Believe </s>
<s> No doctrine in James's thinking has been more persistently misunderstood </s>
<s> Yet it rests on the simplest of insights that atheism and theism are both dogmas for there is scientific evidence for neither that to withhold judgment is really to make a judgment and act as if God didn't exist that until the evidence is complete men have a right to believe what they most need </s>
<s> James has acted upon that right </s>
<s> He has made a picture compounded of the insights of feeling the elaborations of reason and the daily requirements of men </s>
<s> It is a huge guess if you like to be verified only at the end of the world </s>
<s> But it has made many men at home in the universe </s>
<s> And this democrat understood the need of feeling at home in the world and he understood also that the aristocrats are not at home here </s>
<s> Perhaps that's why they are aristocrats </s>
<s> The luxurious classes he says are blind to man's real relation to the globe he lives on and to the permanently hard and solid foundations of his higher life </s>
<s> And he prescribed for themfor their culture I meanthis treatment To coal and iron mines to freight trains to fishing fleets in December to dishwashing clotheswashing and windowwashing to roadbuilding and tunnelmaking to foundries and stokeholes and to the frames of skyscrapers would our gilded youths be drafted off according to their choice to get the childishness knocked out of them and to come back into society with healthier sympathies and soberer ideas </s>
<s> This and thoughts like this and kindnesses like this put James not alone among the democrats of this uncertain world but among the poets also among the poetic philosophers who like Goethe Schopenhauer and Whitman have a sense of the pace of things </s>
<s> Sunlight and stormcloud the subdued busyness of outdoors the rumble of cities the mud of life's beginning and the heaven of its hopes stain his pages with the glad sweaty sense of life itself </s>
<s> It is an encouraging thought that America should have produced perhaps the most tolerant man of our generation </s>
<s> It is a stimulating thought that he was a man whose tolerance never meant the kind of timidity which refuses to take a stand because there is so much to be said on both sides </s>
<s> As every one knows he fought hard for his ideas because he believed in them and because he wanted others to believe in them </s>
<s> The propagandist was strong in William James </s>
<s> He wished to give as well as receive </s>
<s> And he listened for truth from anybody and from anywhere and in any form </s>
<s> He listened for it from Emma Goldman the pope or a sophomore preached from a pulpit a throne or a soapbox in the language of science in slang in fine rhetoric or in the talk of a ward boss </s>
<s> And he told his conclusions </s>
<s> He told them too without the expert's arrogance toward the man in the street and without the dainty and finicky horror of being popular and journalistic </s>
<s> He would quote Mr. Dooley on God to make himself understood among men </s>
<s> He would have heard God gladly in the overalls of a carpenter even though He came to preach that the soul of man is immortal </s>
<s> So openminded was he so very much of a democrat </s>
