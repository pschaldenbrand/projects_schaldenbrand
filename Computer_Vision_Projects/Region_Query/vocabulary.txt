	visualizeVocabulary.m shows you a visual representation of a word from
a bag of words.  It computes the bag of words of a few images, then it 
randomly selects two words to visualize.  It takes examples of these words
from a few images, then displays them.  So all of the 25 images in one of
these figures are examples of one visual word.  They're all features that 
were clustered to the same word.
